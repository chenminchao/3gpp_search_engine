A response including a \"Mandatory\n    IE missing\" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.\n\n  -  Conditional means:\n\n    -  that the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions\n       specified in the relevant protocol specification are met;\n\n    -  the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the\n       corresponding message type description, based on the parameter\n       combination in the message and/or on the state of the receiving node,\n       to infer if a conditional IE shall be expected. Only if a receiver\n       has sufficient information the following applies. A conditional IE,\n       which is absolutely necessary for the receiving entity to complete\n       the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort the\n       procedure.\n\n  -  Conditional-Optional means:\n\n    -  that the IE shall be included by the up-to-date sending entity, if\n       the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are\n       met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and\n       therefore is not up-to-date, obviously cannot send such new IE.\n\n    -  the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message.\n       If the receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE,\n       then the IE's absence shall not trigger any of the error handling\n       procedures. The handling of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be\n       treated as Optional IEs as specified in subclause 7.7 \"Error\n       Handling\".\n\n  -  Optional means:\n\n    -  that the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE\n       may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent\n       optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in subclause\n       7.7 \"Error Handling\".\n\nFor conditional IEs, the clause describing the GTP-PDU explicitly defines\nthe conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or\noptional for that particular GTP-PDU. These conditions shall be defined so\nthat the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is\ncritical for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other\nprotocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.\n\nFor grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow\nthe rules:\n\n  -  The grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence\n    requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the\n    Mandatory grouped IE for the given message.\n\n  -  The grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded\n    IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is\n    viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the\n    grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as\n    Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is\n    Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.\n\n  -  The grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the\n    embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this\n    embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If\n    the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this\n    embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded\n    IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as\n    Optional IE by the receiver.\n\n  -  The grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in\n    the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.\n\nIn all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in\nsubclause 7.7 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.\n\nOnly the Cause information element at message level shall be included in\nthe response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request\nis not accepted regardless of whether there are other mandatory or\nconditional information elements defined for a given response message.\n\nThe following are exceptions:\n\n  -  Optionally, the Protocol Configuration Options, Recovery, User\n    Location Information (ULI), Load Control Information, Overload Control\n    Information, Bearer Context and Local Distinguished Name (LDN)\n    information elements may be included.\n\n  -  For the rejection response of a Forward Relocation Request, the\n    Forward Relocation Response message may also include an F-Cause IE as\n    specified in clause 7.3.2.\n\n  -  For the rejection response of a SRVCC PS to CS Request, the SRVCC PS\n    to CS Response message may also include an SRVCC Cause IE as specified\n    in clause 5.2.3 in 3GPP TS 29.280 [15].\n\n  -  A Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge (with or) without an\n    indication of success may also include a DL low priority traffic\n    Throttling IE and the IMSI IE.\n\n  -  The PGW Back-Off Time IE may also be returned when rejecting a Create\n    Session Request with the cause \"APN Congestion\".\n\n  -  Change Notification Response message may also include the IMSI and MEI\n    information elements.\n\n  -  Failure Indication type messages do not have \"Accept\" types of Cause\n    values, i.e. all used values indicate the rejection, therefore for\n    Failure Indication type of triggered messages, other information\n    elements, other than the Cause IE, shall also be included according to\n    the conditions of presence specified in the respective message, if they\n    are available.\n\n  -  The Context Response message (sent by an SGSN or MME) should also\n    include the IMSI IE if the Cause IE contains the value \"P-TMSI\n    Signature mismatch\", except if the UE is emergency attached and the UE\n    is UICCless.\n\n  -  The Create Bearer Response message, the Update Bearer Response message\n    and the Delete Bearer Response message shall include the RAN/NAS Cause\n    IE according to the conditions specified in subclauses 7.2.4, 7.2.16\n    and 7.2.10.2.\n\n  -  The UE Registration Query Response message shall include IMSI to allow\n    the SGSN to correlate the response message with the corresponding\n    request.\n\nIf the Cause information element at Grouped IE level contains a value that\nindicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, e.g. \"Context Not\nFound\" at Bearer Context IE level, the other information elements in this\nGrouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Grouped Information Elements", "numbering": "6.1.2", "title_level": 2, "desc": "6.1.2  Grouped Information Elements\n\nInformation elements can contain other IEs.

Before creating the new session,\nthe SGW should delete:\n\n  -  the existing PDN connection context locally, if the Create Session\n    Request is received with the TEID set to zero in the header, or if it\n    is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header and it collides\n    with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;\n\n  -  the existing dedicated bearer context locally, if the Create Session\n    Request collides with an existing dedicated bearer context and the\n    message is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header.\n\nIn the former case, if the PGW S5/S8 IP address for control plane received\nin the new Create Session Request is different from the PGW S5/S8 IP\naddress for control plane of the existing PDN connection, the SGW should\nalso delete the existing PDN connection in the corresponding PGW by sending\na Delete Session Request message.\n\n  NOTE 1:  The SGW can send the Create Session Request and Delete Session\n         Request over S5/S8 asynchronously, e.g. the SGW can send the Delete\n         Session Request and then the Create Session Request without having\n         to wait for the Delete Session Response. It does not matter if the\n         PGW happens to receive the Delete Session Request after the Create\n         Session Request since the PGW assigns a different S5/S8 F-TEID for\n         control plane to the new PDN connection.\n\nIf the new Create Session Request received by the PGW collides with an\nexisting PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context is\nidentified with the triplet [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID, Interface type], where\napplicable Interface type here is S2a TWAN GTP-C interface or S2b ePDG GTP-\nC interface or S5/S8 SGW GTP-C interface, and where IMSI shall be replaced\nby TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency attached UE without UICC\nor authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be treated as a\nrequest for a new session. Before creating the new session, the PGW should\ndelete:\n\n  -  the existing PDN connection context, if the Create Session Request\n    collides with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;\n\n  -  the existing dedicated bearer context, if the Create Session Request\n    collides with a dedicated bearer of an existing PDN connection context.\n\nThe PGW shall allocate a new PGW S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new\nPDN connection, i.e. not the same F-TEID value as the one which was\nassigned to the existing PDN connection.\n\n  NOTE 2:  With GTP based S2a and S2b, the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for\n         specific UE over S2a between the TWAN and PGW and over S2b between\n         an ePDG and PGW are independent of the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for\n         the same UE over S5/S8 and may overlap in value (see 3GPP TS 23.402\n         [45] subclause 4.6.2).\n\n  NOTE 3:  Only the TAC and SNR part of the ME Identity is used to identify\n         an emergency

A Modify Bearer\nRequest used as an implicit resume can contain zero or more IE(s),\ndepending on the conditions of presence of the IEs specified in table 7.2.7-\n1. The PGW should not consider a Modify Bearer Request with zero IE as an\nerror.\n\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases\nfrom the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User\nCSG Information or/and UE Time Zone which occured during a previous RAU\nprocedure without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the\nSGW/PGW, or to indicate to the PGW that the UE is available for signalling\nif the PDN connection is delay tolerant and if there is pending network\ninitiated PDN connection signalling:\n\n  -  during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for\n    the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U\n    tunnel;\n\n  -  when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid\n    LLC frame serving as a paging response from a UE in GERAN with an\n    existing S4-U tunnel.\n\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases\nfrom the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of User Location\nInformation which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN\nchange but which has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, if the S4-SGSN\nis configured to defer the reporting of ULI change until a RAB/user plane\nis established:\n\n  -  during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for\n    the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U\n    tunnel;\n\n  -  when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid\n    LLC frame serving as a paging response for a UE in GERAN with an\n    existing S4-U tunnel.\n\n  NOTE 1:  the S4-SGSN can alternatively send a Change Notification Request\n         message in the above cases, if no other information which requires\n         the sending of a Modify Bearer Request, needs to be reported to the\n         PGW.\n\nThe Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent by the MME to the\nSGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User Location Information,\nUser CSG Information, UE Time Zone or/and RAT Type, when user data is\ntransported in NAS signalling, for a UE with an existing S11-U tunnel.\n\nWhen requesting the PGW to pause or unpause charging for a PDN connection,\nthe SGW shall wait for the PGW acknowledgement (i.e. Modify Bearer\nResponse) before sending a new pause or unpause request.\n\n  NOTE 2:  this ensures that the PGW always act per the most recent SGW\n         request in particular in scenarios where the SGW would need to\n         request the PGW to pause and unpause charging in a row (or vice-\n         versa) and the Modify Bearer Request messages would arrive out of\n         order at the PGW.\n\nUpon receipt of a request from the PGW/PCRF/OCS in a message other than\nCreate Bearer Request and Update Bearer Request to report changes of UE\npresence in new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s), the MME/S4-SGSN\nshall immediately send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change\nNotification Request message to report to the PGW whether the UE is inside\nor outside the new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s) or whether the\nPresence Reporting Area(s) is inactive.\n\nThe MME/S4-SGSN shall also send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change\nNotification Request message to report any subsequent change of UE presence\nin the Presence Reporting Area, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP\nTS 23.060 [35].\n\nIf the Modify Bearer Request message is sent from the old MME/SGSN as part\nof Tracking/Routeing Area Update procedure with SGW change and data\nforwarding as specified in subclause 5.3.3.1A of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], the\nold MME/SGSN shall only include the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE.\n\n  NOTE 3:  Since the UE has left the old MME/SGSN, some information related\n         to the UE, e.g. ULI, UE Time Zone, CSG, RAT Type in the old\n         MME/SGSN are not valid any more.\n\nUpon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Presence\nReporting Area Information from the MME/S4-SGSN, the SGW shall send a\nModify Bearer Request message on the S5/S8 interface if any of the\nfollowing condition is met:\n\n  -  ISR is not active;\n\n  -  ISR is active, and the RAT Type has changed since last reported or the\n    CPRAI flag has been set to 1.\n\nThe MME shall increment the \"MO Exception data counter\" by one each time\nthe MME has received the RRC cause \"MO Exception data\". The MME may defer\nsending a Modify Bearer Request message to report a non-zero value for the\nMO Exception Data Counter based on local configuration.\n\nUpon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Secondary\nRAT Usage Data Report from the MME, the SGW shall send a Modify Bearer\nRequest message on the S5/S8 interface if the IRPGW flag is set to 1 in the\nSecondary RAT Usage Data Report IE.\n\n       Table 7.2.7-1: Information Elements in a Modify Bearer Request\n\n|Information  |P |Condition / Comment                 |IE Type    |Ins|\n|elements     |  |                                    |           |.  |\n|ME Identity  |C |If an SGW receives this IE from an  |MEI        |0  |\n|(MEI)        |  |MME/SGSN during a TAU/RAU/Handover  |           |   |\n|             |  |procedure, the SGW shall forward it |           |   |\n|             |  |across the S5/S8 interface to the   |           |   |\n|             |  |PGW.                                |           |   |\n|             |O |The MME/SGSN may include this IE on |           |   |\n|             |  |the S11/S4 interface if the IMSI is |           |   |\n|             |  |not available.

Upon intra MME/SGSN mobility, the|\n|MME/SGSN shall only report active PRAs whose Presence Reporting Area |\n|Information is changed, e.g. from inside to outside, or vice versa.  |\n|                                                                     |\n|NOTE 23: The PGW may use the IMSI or the MEI to verify if the Modify |\n|Bearer Request message is received for the right UE context. In some |\n|error scenarios, e.g. when a delete bearer request (to delete a PDN  |\n|connection) is lost over S5/S8, the PGW can receive the Modify Bearer|\n|Request message for the hanging PDN connection from the MME/SGSN and |\n|SGW, if the PGW has reassigned the F-TEID of the hanging PDN         |\n|connection for another UE.                                           |\n|NOTE 24: The eNB Change Reporting feature should be supported        |\n|homogeneously across all MMEs in the network.

interface as part of an\n    S1-based handover relocation procedure;\n\n  -  the source MME to the target SGSN, or from the source SGSN to the\n    target MME over the S3 interface as part of an Inter RAT handover and\n    combined hard handover and SRNS relocation procedures;\n\n  -  the source SGSN to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of\n    an SRNS Relocation and PS handover procedures;-  the source MME to the\n    target SGSN over the S3 interface as part of an SRVCC from E-UTRAN to\n    UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support procedures and from the source SGSN\n    to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of SRVCC from UTRAN\n    (HSPA) to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support;\n\n  -  the source MME to the target AMF, or from the source AMF to the target\n    MME over the N26 interface as part of the EPS to 5GS handover and 5GS\n    to EPS handover procedures.\n\nA source MME/SGSN which supports CIoT knows whether the target MME/SGSN\npool or target AMF (5GS) supports some CIoT optimisations either by using\nDNS procedures enhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in\nsubclause 5.9 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. A source AMF knows whether the target\nMME pool supports SGi Non-IP PDN connections either by using DNS procedures\nenhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in subclause 5.9\nof 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. The target MME/SGSN may forward the Forward\nRelocation Request to another MME/SGSN in the target MME/SGSN pool which is\nmore suitable to serve the UE, based on the information received in the\nForward Relocation Request message, e.g. required CIoT EPS optimisation(s)\napplicable to the given UE's attachment.\n\n  NOTE 1:  The source MME/SGSN/AMF does not need to know each individual\n         CIoT feature the target MME/SGSN pool or target AMF (5GS) supports.\n         The source MME/SGSN/AMF can behave as if the target MME/SGSN/AMF\n         pool supports all CIoT features when the target MME/SGSN pool is\n         known to support CIoT; the source MME/SGSN/AMF determines then\n         which bearer contexts were successfully transferred as specified in\n         sunclause 7.3.2.\n\n  NOTE 2:  Among the CIoT optimization features, only the support of SCEF\n         Non-IP PDN connection and the support of SGi Non-IP PDN connection\n         are applicable to a SGSN.\n\n  NOTE 3:  5GS supports Attach without PDU session. 5GS can also support\n         Unstructured and Ethernet PDU session types, which are assimilated\n         to \"SGi Non-IP PDN connections\" over N26.\n\nForward Relocation procedure across S10 interface (when KASME is taken into\nuse) shall be performed according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of\nSecurity Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].\n\nWhen the source MME/SGSN supports one or more of the CIoT optimization\nfeatures as specified in subclause 8.125, the source MME/SGSN shall\ntransfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections or for PDN\nconnections to a SCEF only if the target serving node is known to support\nSGi Non-IP PDN connections or SCEF Non-IP PDN connections respectively, as\nspecified in subclause 5.5.1.2.1 and 5.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. Likewise,\na source AMF shall transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN\nconnections only if the target MME is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN\nconnections. The source MME/SGSN/AMF shall not proceed with the Forward\nRelocation Request procedure if the UE does not have any EPS bearer\ncontext(s) for SGi IP or Non-IP PDN connections that can be transferred to\nthe target serving node, i.e. under the following conditions:\n\n  -  If the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only the PDN\n    connection(s) of PDN type \"non-IP\" through the SGW and the PGW, with or\n    without SCEF PDN connections, and the target serving node is known to\n    not support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection (as specified in subclause\n    4.3.17.8.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and in subclause 5.3.13.8 of\n    3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023\u00a0060\u00a0[35]); or\n\n  -  If the UE is attached to the source AMF (5GS) with only PDU session(s)\n    of type \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\", and the target MME is known to\n    not support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection.\n\nTable 7.3.1-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs\nin the message.\n\n     Table 7.3.1-1: Information Elements in a Forward Relocation Request\n\n|Information  |P |Condition / Comment                 |IE Type    |Ins|\n|elements     |  |                                    |           |.  |\n|IMSI         |C |The IMSI shall be included in the   |IMSI       |0  |\n|             |  |message, except if the UE is        |           |   |\n|             |  |emergency attached and the UE is    |           |   |\n|             |  |UICCless.                           |           |   |\n|             |  |The IMSI shall be included in the   |           |   |\n|             |  |message but not used as an          |           |   |\n|             |  |identifier if UE is emergency       |           |   |\n|             |  |attached but IMSI is not            |           |   |\n|             |  |authenticated.                      |           |   |\n|Sender's     |M |                                    |F-TEID     |0  |\n|F-TEID for   |  |                                    |           |   |\n|Control Plane|  |                                    |           |   |\n|MME/SGSN/AMF |C |This IE shall be present, except    |PDN        |0  |\n|UE EPS PDN   |  |over the S16 interface if there is  |Connection |   |\n|Connections  |  |no active PDP context and the source|           |   |\n|             |  |and target SGSNs supports SRNS      |           |   |\n|             |  |relocation w/o PDN connection over  |           |   |\n|             |  |GTPv2 (see NOTE 2).                 |           |   |\n|             |  |                                    |           |   |\n|             |  |If the target MME/SGSN is known to  |           |   |\n|             |  |not support SGi Non-IP PDN          |           |   |\n|             |  |Connection (as specified in         |           |   |\n|             |  |subclause 4.3.17.8.3.3 of 3GPP TS   |           |   |\n|             |  |23.401 [3] and in subclause 5.3.13.8|           |   |\n|             |  |of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023\u00a0060\u00a0[35]), then the   |           |   |\n|             |  |source MME/SGSN/AMF shall only      |           |   |\n|             |  |include PDN Connections of IP PDN   |           |   |\n|             |  |type.                               |           |   |\n|             |  |                                    |           |   |\n|             |  |Several IEs with this type and      |           |   |\n|             |  |instance values shall be included as|           |   |\n|             |  |necessary to represent a list of PDN|           |   |\n|             |  |Connections                         |           |   |\n|SGW S11/S4 IP|C |This IE shall be present, except    |F-TEID     |1  |\n|Address and  |  |over the S16 interface if there is  |           |   |\n|TEID for     |  |no active PDP context and the source|           |   |\n|Control Plane|  |and target SGSNs supports SRNS      |           |   |\n|             |  |relocation w/o PDN connection over  |           |   |\n|             |  |GTPv2 (see NOTE 2).                 |           |   |\n|             |  |                                    |           |   |\n|             |  |Over the N26 interface, the source  |           |   |\n|             |  |AMF shall set the IP address and    |           |   |\n|             |  |TEID to the following values:       |           |   |\n|             |  |- any reserved TEID (e.g. all 0's,  |           |   |\n|             |  |or all 1's);                        |           |   |\n|             |  |- IPv4 address set to 0.0.0.0, or   |           |   |\n|             |  |IPv6 Prefix Length and IPv6 prefix  |           |   |\n|             |  |and Interface Identifier all set to |           |   |\n|             |  |zero.                               |           |   |\n|SGW node name|C |This IE identifies the SGW that was |FQDN       |0  |\n|             |  |used by the old MME/S4-SGSN.

The Core Network    |\n|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |\n|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |\n|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |\n|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |\n|NOTE 7: A UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used  |\n|for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not |\n|support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the   |\n|sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage   |\n|type was received in UE's subscription.                              |\n|NOTE 8: There may be a pending MT Short Message at the SMS-GMSC      |\n|during a handover scenario, when the UE performs a Service Request   |\n|towards the source MME/SGSN and a handover procedure occurs shortly  |\n|afterward, before the SMS-GMSC is alerted to retransmit the pending  |\n|MT Short Message.                                                    |\n|NOTE 9:  The target MME may compare the value of the Serving PLMN    |\n|Rate Control received in the Forward Relocation Request message with |\n|the one configured locally, to determine if this parameter needs to  |\n|be updated towards the SCEF.

This parameter is exchanged when ISR is being     |\n|activated and used in the source MME/SGSN for this decision upon     |\n|subsequent inter-RAT handover.                                       |\n|NOTE 4: If the SGSN needs to include the last used LTE PLMN ID in the|\n|Equivalent PLMN list it sends to the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [21]),   |\n|the SGSN shall derive the last used LTE PLMN ID from the Old RAI IE  |\n|received in the RAU request message.                                 |\n|NOTE 5: In shared networks, when the message is sent from the VPLMN  |\n|to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in this IE shall be   |\n|that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or    |\n|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |\n|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |\n|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |\n|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |\n|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |\n|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |\n|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |\n|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |\n|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |\n|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |\n|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |\n|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |\n|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |\n|NOTE 6: A UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used  |\n|for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not |\n|support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the   |\n|sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage   |\n|type was received in UE's subscription.                              |\n|NOTE 7: The old RAT shall be used by the target MME/SGSN to determine|\n|if the RAT type has changed and, if so, to decide whether to maintain|\n|or deactivate the PDN connections of the UE based on the             |\n|PDN-Connection-Continuity subscription parameter and operator policy,|\n|as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35]. A target |\n|MME shall consider that the RAT type has changed if the target RAT is|\n|NB-IoT and a source MME (complying with an earlier version of the    |\n|specification) does not include the RAT Type IE in the Context       |\n|Response.                                                            |\n|NOTE 8:  The target MME may compare the value of the Serving PLMN    |\n|Rate Control received in the Context Response message with the one   |\n|configured locally, to determine if such parameter needs to be       |\n|updated towards the SCEF and/or PGW.                                 |\n\n\n   Table 7.3.6-2: MME/SGSN UE EPS PDN Connections within Context Response\n\n|Octet 1      |  |PDN Connection IE Type = 109        |           |   |\n|             |  |(decimal)                           |           |   |\n|APN          |M |                                    |APN        |0  |\n|APN          |C |This IE denotes the restriction on  |APN        |0  |\n|Restriction  |  |the combination of types of APN for |Restriction|   |\n|             |  |the APN associated with this EPS    |           |   |\n|             |  |bearer Context.

The message at the front of the queue shall be sent\nwith a Sequence Number, and if the message has an expected reply, it shall\nbe held in a list until a reply is received or until the GTP entity has\nceased retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique\nfor each outstanding Initial message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint.\nA node running GTP may have several outstanding messages waiting for\nreplies.  Not counting retransmissions, a single GTP message with an\nexpected reply shall be answered with a single GTP reply, regardless\nwhether it is per UE, per APN, or per bearer\n\nA piggybacked initial message (such as a Create Bearer Request message or\nModify Bearer Request message) shall contain a Sequence Number that is\nassigned by sending GTP entity and the message shall be held in a list\nuntil a response is received. The response message to a piggybacked initial\nmessage may arrive without piggybacking (e.g., Create Bearer Response at\nPGW).\n\nThe Sequence Number in the GTP header of the triggered response message\nshall be copied from the respective request message.\n\nIf a request message (e.g., Create Session Request) triggers piggybacking\n(i.e., Create Bearer Request piggybacked on Create Session Response), re-\ntransmission of the request message shall also trigger piggybacking.  A\nSequence Number used for a Command message shall have the most significant\nbit set to 1. A Sequence Number in a message, which was triggered by a\nCommand message, as well as respective Triggered Reply message shall have\nthe same Sequence Number as the Command message (i.e. shall also have the\nmost significant bit set to 1). This setting of the most significant bit of\nthe Sequence Number is done to avoid potential clashes between the Sequence\nNumber selected for a Command message, and the Sequence Number selected by\na GTPv2 peer for a Request message, which was not triggered by a Command\nmessage.\n\nA Sequence Number used for a Request message, which was not triggered by a\nCommand message shall have the most significant bit set to 0.\n\nA timer, denoted T3-RESPONSE, shall be started when a signalling message\n(for which a reply is expected) is sent. A signalling message or the\ntriggered message has probably been lost if a reply has not been received\nbefore the T3-RESPONSE timer expires.\n\nOnce the T3-RESPONSE timer expires, the message corresponding to the T3-\nRESPONSE timer is then retransmitted if the total number of retry attempts\nis less than N3-REQUESTS times. The expiry of the timer for piggybacked\nrequest messages shall result in re-transmission of the original IP/UDP\npacket containing both the triggered response message and the piggybacked\ninitial message. T3-RESPONSE timer and N3-REQUESTS counter setting is\nimplementation dependent. That is, the timers and counters may be\nconfigurable per procedure. Multileg communications (e.g. Create Session\nRequests and Responses) however require longer timer values and possibly a\nhigher number of retransmission attempts compared to single leg\ncommunication.\n\nAll received GTPv2 messages with an expected reply shall be replied to and\nall reply messages associated with a certain message shall always include\nthe same information. Duplicated reply messages shall be discarded by the\nreceiver unless the reply needs a reply. A received reply message without a\nmatching outstanding message that is waiting for a reply should be\ndiscarded.\n\nIf a GTPv2 node is not successful with the transfer of a non-Echo\nsignalling message, e.g. a Create Bearer Request message, it shall inform\nthe upper layer of the unsuccessful transfer so that the controlling upper\nentity may take the necessary measures.\n\n  NOTE:  At failure of sending a GTPv2 message after retransmissions, some\n         information included in the message may be lost, e.g. Secondary RAT\n         data usage report.\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Error Handling", "numbering": "7.7", "title_level": 1, "desc": "7.7  Error Handling\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Handling Piggybacked Messages", "numbering": "7.7.0", "title_level": 2, "desc": "7.7.0  Handling Piggybacked Messages\n\nFor piggybacked initial messages, the following general rule shall apply:\nthe triggered response message carrying the piggybacked message shall be\nprocessed first, according to the following sections.

GTPv2 information element type values are specified\nin the Table 8.1-1. The last column of this table indicates whether the\ninformation element is:\n\n  -  Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of\n    octets.\n\n  -  Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable\n    number of octets.\n    For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to \"5 to (n+4)\".\n    In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then the\n    last field is not present.\n\n  -  Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable\n    number of octets.\n    The last fields are typically specified with the statement: \"These\n    octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified\". The legacy\n    receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.\n\nIn order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended\nthat the information elements should be arranged in the signalling messages\nas well as in the grouped IEs, according to the order the information\nelements are listed in the message definition table or grouped IE\ndefinition table in section 7. However the receiving entity shall be\nprepared to handle the messages with information elements in any order.\n\nWithin information elements, certain fields may be described as spare.\nThese bits shall be transmitted with the value set to 0. To allow for\nfuture features, the receiver shall not evaluate these bits. GTPv2-C\ninformation elements that have similar semantics in GTPv1-C shall be\nconverted into GTPv1-C format, as specified in TS 29.060 [4], before\nsending them to a pre-R8 GSN.\n\n

This bit is set to 0\n    to denote that the corresponding error cause is originated by the node\n    sending the message.\n\n    The CS should be set to 1 by the SGW when the SGW relay a response\n    message with cause value from the MME/SGSN to the PGW or from the PGW\n    to the MME/SGSN. For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW shall set the CS bit to\n    1 when the SGW/MAG relay a response message with the cause value from\n    the PGW/LMA to the MME/SGSN.\n\n  -  Bit 2 \u2013 BCE (Bearer Context IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it\n    indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in\n    the Bearer Context IE.

This bit shall be discarded if the cause value\n    is one of Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.\n\nThe Cause value shall be included in a response message.

When \"Context\nNot Found\" is received at message level together with a known TEID-C in the\nGTPv2-C header in the response message, this indicates some bearer contexts\nare not known in the peer; the sender of the request message should further\ndetermine, based on the bearer context(s) included in the request message,\nthat:\n\n  -  if the default bearer is unknown, this means the PDN connection is not\n    known in the peer;\n\n  -  if one or more dedicated bearers are unknown, this means only those\n    dedicated bearer contexts are not known in the peer.\n\n\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response\nmessage during the non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover procedures, if the\nrequest corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not\nexist in the PGW.\n\n\"Context Not Found\" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response\nmessage during the 3GPP to non-3GPP access handover procedures, if the\nrequest corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not\nexist in the PGW.\n\n\"Service not supported\" is used by the GTP entity when it receives a\nmessage, which corresponds to a feature or a service which is not supported\nby the node.\n\n\"Service denied\" is used when the requested service cannot be granted.\n\n\"System failure\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate a generic error\ncondition.\n\n\"No resources available\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate the\ntemporary unavailability of the resource(s) to process the received\nrequest.\n\n\"Semantic error in the TFT operation\", \"Syntactic error in the TFT\noperation\", \"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\", \"Syntactic errors in\npacket filters(s)\", \"UE context without TFT already activated\", \"Semantic\nerror in the TAD operation\" and \"Syntactic error in the TAD operation\" are\nindications of error cases involving TFT(s)/TAD(s) as specified in\nsubclause 7.7.11 in this specification.\n\n\"Missing or unknown APN\" is used by the PGW when it does not support the\nAccess Point Name, received in Create Session Request message.\n\n\"Relocation failure\" is used by the target MME/S4-SGSN to indicate the\nsource MME/S4-SGSN that the relocation has failed.\n\n\"Relocation failure due to NAS message redirection\" is used by the new\nMME/S4-SGSN to indicate to the old MME/S4-SGSN that the TAU/RAU procedure\nis not successful due to NAS message redirection as described in 3GPP TS\n23.401 [3].\n\n\"Denied in RAT\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the requested\nservice is not accepted in the RAT.\n\n\"Preferred PDN type not supported\" is used by the PGW to indicate that the\nPDN type received in the Create Session Request message is not supported by\nthe PGW for the PDN corresponding to the received Access Point Name.\n\n\"Protocol type not supported\" is used by the SGW to indicate that the S5/S8\nprotocol type requested by the MME/S4-SGSN is not supported by it.\n\n\"UE not responding\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate that the UE is\nnot responding to the request initiated by the network, e.g. Paging.\n\n\"UE refuses\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the UE, without\nspecifying further detail, rejected the request from the network.\n\n\"Unable to page UE\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate its inability to\npage the UE, temporarily.\n\n\"User authentication failed\" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the\nrequest is rejected due to failure in authentication/security procedure.\n\n\"APN access denied \u2013 no subscription\" is used to indicate that the PGW has\ndenied the user access to an APN because a subscription is required, but\nthe subscriber does not have the necessary subscription.\n\n\"Remote peer not responding\" is used by the SGW for the messages spanning\nthrough two interfaces.  This cause value is returned by the SGW to the\nMME/S4-SGSN or PGW in a response message where no response message is\nreceived from the PGW or MME/S4-SGSN.\n\n\"Collision with network initiated request\" is used by the PGW to indicate\nthat the UE-initiated bearer resource allocation/modification request is\nrejected since the PGW has requested a bearer resource\nallocation/modification for the same service using a network-initiated\nprocedure.\n\n\"Unable to page UE due to Suspension\" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to\nindicate that the UE has not been paged because the bearers of the UE are\nin a suspended state.\n\n\"APN Restriction type Incompatible with currently active PDN connection\" is\nused by the PGW to indicate that the newly requested PDN connection has APN\nrestriction value that is not compatible with the currently active PDN\nconnection(s)'s APN restriction value(s).\n\n\"Invalid peer\" is used by the SGW to indicate that currently the UE is\nbeing managed by the different node (e.g. MME/S4-SGSN) than the node (e.g.\nS4-SGSN/MME) which has sent the Delete Session Request message.\n\n\"Invalid Reply from remote peer\" is used by the SGW for the messages\nspanning through two interfaces. This cause value is returned by the SGW to\nthe MME/SGSN or PGW in a reply message where the corresponding reply\nmessage on S5/S8 or S11/S4 from the PGW or MME/SGSN is not decoded as\nvalid.\n\n\"Temporarily rejected due to handover/TAU/RAU procedure in progress\" is\nused by the MME/S4-SGSN for the bearer related procedure initiated by the\nPGW. When the handover/TAU/RAU with/without SGW change and/or MME/S4-SGSN\nchange is in progress, the MME/S4-SGSN may receive Create / Update / Delete\nBearer request message for the bearer creation, modification or deletion\ninitiated by the PGW. If the handover/TAU/RAU procedure results in the SGW\nand/or MME/S4-SGSN change, then the bearer related procedure cannot be\nhandled temporarily by the MME/S4-SGSN till the handover/TAU/RAU procedure\nis completed. In that case the MME/S4-SGSN shall reject the bearer related\nprocedure with this rejection cause. This cause is also used to indicate\nthat the Downlink Data Notification message is rejected temporarily due to\nthe mobility procedures with MME or SGSN change in progress as specified in\nsub-clause 5.3.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].\n\nThe usage of \"Fallback to GTPv1\" is specified in subclause 7.10 \"Fallback\nto GTPv1 mechanism\".\n\nIn the PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure for the default bearer,\nthe PGW may include the Cause IE in the Delete Bearer Request with values\n\"RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP\", \"Reactivation requested\" or\n\"Reactivation disallowed to APN\".\n\n\"APN Congestion\" is used by the PGW and it indicates that the PGW has\ndetected congestion for the requested APN and performs overload control for\nthat APN which does not allow the PDN connection to be established.\n\n\"GTP-C Entity Congestion\" is used to indicate that the GTP-C entity has\ndetected node level congestion and performs overload control at the node\nlevel, which does not allow the request to be processed.\n\n\"UE already re-attached\" is used by MME/S4-SGSN for the network triggered\nservice restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]. The\nMME/S4-SGSN may send the Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge or Downlink\nData Notification Failure Indication with this cause as part of the network\ntriggered service restoration procedure.\n\n\"PDP connection inactivity timer expires\" is used by the PGW in Delete\nBearer Request(s) to indicate that all the bearer(s) for the emergency PDN\nconnection are deleted upon the inactivity timer expiry as specified in\n3GPP TS 23.203 [48].\n\n\"Network failure\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session Request\nto indicate that the message is sent due to a network problem.\n\n\"QoS parameter mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session\nRequest to indicate that the PDN connection can not be established due to a\nQoS parameter mismatch.\n\n\"MME/SGSN refuses due to VPLMN policy\" is used by the MME/SGSN in the VPLMN\nto indicate to the PGW in the Create Bearer Response or Update Bearer\nResponse that it does not allow the establishment or modification of the\nbearer due to VPLMN operator's policy.\n\nThe listed cause values for rejection response message descriptions in\nclause 7 are not meant to be exhaustive lists. Therefore a GTPv2 node shall\nuse the most appropriate matching rejection response cause value that is\nlisted in Table 8.4-1.\n\nIf a Bearer Resource Command message is related to an established PDN\nconnection for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject\nthe Bearer Resource Command with the cause value of \"Bearer handling not\nsupported\".\n\n\"Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed\" is used by SGW for\nreply message to the MME/S4-SGSN when PMIP-based S5/S8 is used. If either\nSGW or PGW does not support the multiple PDN connections to the same APN\nfunction, the SGW shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure with\nthis rejection cause when receiving Create Session Request for additional\nPDN connectivity to the given APN from the same UE.\n\nAs specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause\n9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to network\npreference\" indicates that the UE has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and only\nIPv4 or IPv6 address is allowed for the PDN based on PGW operator policy.\n\nAs specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause\n9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value \"New PDN type due to single\naddress bearer only\" indicates that the MS has requested PDN type IPv4v6\nand both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual\nAddress Bearer Flag of the Indication IE is set to 0 or the Indication IE\nis absent, or only single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN.\n\n\"PGW not responding\" is used by the SGW in PGW Restart Notification to\nindicate that the peer PGW has failed and not restarted as specified in\nsubclause 7.9.5.\n\n\"UE context without TFT already activated\" is used by the PGW in the Bearer\nResource Failure Indication message to indicate that the PGW has received\nthe Bearer Resource Command message without TAD IE in the secondary PDP\nContext Activation procedure.\n\n\"Target access restricted for the subscriber\" is used by the MME/SGSN in\nthe Context Response message to indicate that the target access is\nprohibited for the subscriber, based on the subscription profile.\n\n\"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\" is used by the SGSN or MME in the\nIdentification Response and Context Response message if the P-TMSI\nSignature stored in the old SGSN or MME does not match the value sent by\nthe UE via the new SGSN or MME.\n\n\"Late Overlapping Request\" is used by the PGW in the Create Session\nResponse to indicate that the incoming request collides with an existing\nsession which has a more recent time stamp than the time stamp of the new\nrequest, as specified in subclause 13.2.\n\n\"Timed Out Request\" is used by the SGW and PGW in the Create Session\nResponse to indicate that the incoming request is known to have already\ntimed out at the originating entity, as specified in subclause 13.3.\n\n\"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving\" is used by the\nMME/SGSN in the Create/Update Bearer Response message to reject the\ncorresponding network initiated procedures for a Delay Tolerant PDN\nconnection and also request the PGW to hold the network initiated procedure\nuntil it receives the subsequent Modify Bearer Request message with the\nUASI flag indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.\n\n\"UE not authorised by OCS or external AAA Server\" is used by the PGW in the\nCreate Session Response to reject the corresponding UE initiated procedures\nwhen the OCS or an external AAA Server on SGi did not authorise it and the\nsupport of the Cause Code was indicated by the SGSN/MME within the Create\nSession Request.\n\nIf a Create Session Request message requests the addition of an access to a\nPDN connection, and NBIFOM is not supported by the MME/SGSN, SGW or TWAN,\nthe PGW should reject the request with the cause value of \"Multiple\naccesses to a PDN connection not allowed\". This cause is also used by the\nPGW in the Delete Bearer Request message to initiate the removal of 3GPP\naccess from the PDN connection due to detection of the MME/SGSN or SGW not\nsupporting NBIFOM at the inter-PLMN mobility procedure.\n\n\"Request rejected due to UE capability\" is used by the MME in the Create\nBearer Response to reject the request to add an EPS bearer that would\nexceed the UE capability (e.g. a NB-IoT UE can only support up to 2 EPS\nbearers). This cause value does not prevent the PGW from sending Create\nBearer Request later.\n\n                          Table 8.4-1: Cause values\n\n|Message   |Cause     |Meaning                                           |\n|Type      |value     |                                                  |\n|          |(decimal) |                                                  |\n|          |0         |Reserved.

If the\nnew MME/AMF is not in the same serving network domain, then only the\ncurrent EPS Security Context may be transmitted. The mapping of an EPS\nsecurity context to a 5G security context in the new AMF is specified in\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.501\u00a0[86]. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may\nbe included. The field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value\n'0'  if no Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '46 to g' are\nabsent). Authentication Quintuplets shall not be transmitted to the new\nMME/AMF (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' shall be absent) even if the old MME has\nthe Authentication Quintuplets for this UE. The field 'Number of\nQuintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The reasons for not sending\nQuintuplets are specified in3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6.\n\nThe current EPS Security Context may be transmitted by the old AMF to the\nnew MME, where the mapping of a 5G security context to an EPS security\ncontext is specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.501\u00a0[86]. The field 'Number of\nQuadruplets' and 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The\nAMF shall not transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall\ndiscard any un-used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless\nof whether the MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network\ndomains.\n\nThe Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are\nspecified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.\n\nThe value of the NAS Downlink Count shall be set to the value that shall be\nused to send the next NAS message.\n\nThe value of the NAS Uplink Count shall be set to the largest NAS Uplink\nCount that was in a successfully integrity verified NAS message.\n\nIn Figure 8.38-5, the fields for the Old EPS Security Context (i.e. octets\nfrom s to s+64) may be present only in S10 Forward Relocation Request\nmessage according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of Security\nProcedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The octets for Old\nEPS Security Context shall be present if the OSCI (Old Security Context\nIndicator), bit 1 of octet 6) is set to \"1\"; otherwise they shall not be\npresent.\n\nIf NHI_old (Next Hop Indicator for old EPS Security Context), bit 1 of\noctet s, is set to \"1\", then the parameters old NH (Next Hop) and old NCC\n(Next Hop Chaining Count) shall be present; otherwise the octets for old NH\nparameter shall not be present and the value of old NCC parameter shall be\nignored by the receiver.\n\n\n\n| |        |Bits                                |    |\n| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |\n| |2 to 3  |Length = n                          |    |\n| |4       |Spare            |Instance         |    |\n| |5       |Security Mode|NHI |DRXI|KSIASME      |    |\n| |6       |Number of    |Number of    |UAMB|OSCI|    |\n| |        |Quintuplets  |Quadruplet   |RI  |    |    |\n| |7       |SAMB|Used NAS     |Used NAS Cipher  |    |\n| |        |RI  |integrity    |                 |    |\n| |        |    |protection   |                 |    |\n| |        |    |algorithm    |                 |    |\n| |8 to 10 |NAS Downlink Count                  |    |\n| |11 to 13|NAS Uplink Count                    |    |\n| |14 to 45|KASME                               |    |\n| |46 to g |Authentication Quadruplet [1..5]    |    |\n| |(g+1) to|Authentication Quintuplet [1..5]    |    |\n| |h       |                                    |    |\n| |(h+1) to|DRX parameter                       |    |\n| |(h+2)   |                                    |    |\n| |p to    |NH                                  |    |\n| |(p+31)  |                                    |    |\n| |p+32    |Spare                 |NCC          |    |\n| |j to    |Uplink Subscribed UE AMBR           |    |\n| |(j+3)   |                                    |    |\n| |(j+4) to|Downlink Subscribed UE AMBR         |    |\n| |(j+7)   |                                    |    |\n| |i to    |Uplink Used UE AMBR                 |    |\n| |(i+3)   |                                    |    |\n| |(i+4) to|Downlink Used UE AMBR               |    |\n| |(i+7)   |                                    |    |\n| |q       |Length of UE Network Capability     |    |\n| |(q+1) to|UE Network Capability               |    |\n| |k       |                                    |    |\n| |k+1     |Length of MS Network Capability     |    |\n| |(k+2) to|MS Network Capability               |    |\n| |m       |                                    |    |\n| |m+1     |Length of Mobile Equipment Identity |    |\n| |        |(MEI)                               |    |\n| |(m+2) to|Mobile Equipment Identity (MEI)     |    |\n| |r       |                                    |    |\n| |r+1     |ECNA|NBNA|HNNA         |ENA          |INA |\n| |(s+1) to|old KASME                           |    |\n| |(s+32)  |                                    |    |\n| |(s+33)  |old NH                              |    |\n| |to      |                                    |    |\n| |(s+64)  |                                    |    |\n| |w       |Length of Voice Domain Preference   |    |\n| |        |and UE's Usage Setting              |    |\n| |(w+1) to|Voice Domain Preference and UE's    |    |\n| |t       |Usage Setting                       |    |\n| |(t+1) to|                                    |    |\n| |(t+2)   |                                    |    |\n| |(t+3) to|                                    |    |\n| |u       |                                    |    |\n| |        |Length of UE Radio Capability for   |    |\n| |        |Paging information                  |    |\n| |        |UE Radio Capability for Paging      |    |\n| |        |information                         |    |\n| |u+1     |Length of Extended Access           |    |\n| |        |Restriction Data                    |    |\n| |(u+2) to|Spare                     |USSR|NRSR|    |\n| |v       |                          |NA  |NA  |    |\n| |v+1     |Length of UE additional security    |    |\n| |        |capability                          |    |\n| |(v+2) to|UE additional security capability   |    |\n| |x       |                                    |    |\n| |x+1     |Length of UE NR security capability |    |\n| |(x+2) to|UE NR security capability           |    |\n| |y       |                                    |    |\n| |y+1 to  |These octet(s) is/are present only  |    |\n| |(n+4)   |if explicitly specified             |    |\n\n\n             Figure 8.38-5: EPS Security Context and Quadruplets\n\nIf NHI (Next Hop Indicator), bit 5 of octet 5, is set to \"1\", then the\noptional parameters NH (Next Hop) and NCC (Next Hop Chaining Count) are\nboth present, otherwise their octets are not present.\n\nThe UE Radio Capability for Paging information is specified in the\nsubclause 9.2.1.98 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]. If Length of UE Radio Capability\nfor Paging information is zero, then the UE Radio Capability for Paging\ninformation shall not be present. The old MME shall, when available,\ninclude UE Radio Capability for Paging information to the new MME as\nspecified in the subclause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [4].\n\nThe Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary\nRAT Not Allowed) and of USSRNA (Unlicensed Spectrum in the form of LAA or\nLWA/LWIP as Secondary RAT Not Allowed).\n\nThe UE additional security capability coding is specified in clause\n9.9.3.53 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23]. If Length of UE additional security\ncapability is zero, then the field UE additional security capability in\noctets \"(v+2) to x\" shall not be present.\n\nThe UE NR security capability coding is specified in clause 9.8.3.57 of\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[87]. If Length of UE NR security capability is zero, then\nthe field UE NR security capability in octets \"(x+2) to y\" shall not be\npresent.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 8.38-6, the old MME will derive CK' and IK' from\nKASME and transmit the CK' and IK' to the new SGSN. Authentication\nQuintuplets, if available, shall be transmitted to the SGSN if, and only if\nthe MME received them from this SGSN earlier, according to 3GPP TS 33.401\n[12] clause 6.1.5. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be\nincluded. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'\nif no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' are\nabsent). An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included.\nThe field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value '0' if no\nAuthentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to g' are absent). A\nkey KASME shall never be transmitted to an SGSN according to 3GPP TS 33.401\n[12] clause 6.4.\n\nThe Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are\nspecified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.\n\nThe old SGSN/MME may deliver both Authentication Quadruplets and\nAuthentication Quintuplets it holds to the peer combo node to optimize the\nprocedure.\n\n  NOTE:  3GPP TS 33.401 [12] states that \"EPS authentication data shall not\n         be forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN\". The statement above\n         assumes that the old MME can determine by local configuration that\n         the peer node is a combo SGSN/MME (as opposed to a single SGSN).\n\n\n\n| |        |Bits

In normal conditions, requests\nsent by a GTP-C entity can be processed by the receiving GTP-C entity which\ncan send back a message indicating the result of the request\n(success/failure).\n\nOverload situations in a GTP-C entity occur when the number of incoming\nrequests exceeds the maximum request throughput supported by the receiving\nGTP-C entity, e.g. when the internal available resources of the GTP-C\nentity, such as processing power or memory, are not sufficient to serve the\nnumber of incoming requests. As a consequence of the overload situation,\nthe receiving GTP-C entity cannot successfully process the exceeding\nproportion of requests. These requests can be either simply dropped or\nextremely delayed in the processing. At best, the GTP-C entity may have\nenough internal resources to send back to the request initiator a message\nindicating that the requests cannot be successfully processed.

It assumes a transport network that is still\n         capable to exchange signalling traffic.\n\nGiven the nature of GTP-C protocol in how it relies on retransmissions of\nunacknowledged requests (GTP-C is carried over UDP transport), when a GTP-C\nentity experiences overload (or severe overload) the number of\nunacknowledged GTP-C messages compounds exponentially and can lead to a\nnode congestion or even collapse. An overload or failure of a node can lead\nto an increase of the load on the other nodes in the network and, in the\nworst case, turn into a complete network issue via a snowball effect.\n\nThe impact of GTP-C overload to services can be such as:\n\n  -  loss of PDN connectivity (IMS, Internet \u2026) and associated services;\n\n  -  loss of ability to setup and release radio and core network bearers\n    necessary to support services e.g. GBR bearers for VoLTE or dedicated\n    bearers for Voice over WLAN;\n\n  -  loss of ability to report to the PGW/PCRF user's information changes,\n    e.g. location information for emergency services and lawful intercept,\n    changes in RAT or QoS;\n\n  -  and billing errors and a loss of revenue.\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Scenarios leading to overload", "numbering": "12.1.2", "title_level": 2, "desc": "12.1.2 Scenarios leading to overload\n\nReasons for these temporary overload cases can be many and various in an\noperational network, such as insufficient internal resource capacity of a\nGTP-C entity faced with a sudden burst of requests, e.g. after network\nfailure/restart procedures affecting a large number of users, deficiency of\na GTP-C entity component leading to a drastic reduction of the overall\nperformances of the GTP-C entity.\n\nExamples of GTP-C signalling based scenarios which can cause GTP-C overload\nare:\n\n  -  a traffic flood resulting from the failure of a network element,\n    inducing a signalling spike, e.g. when the network needs to re-\n    establish the PDN connections affected by the failure of an EPC node;\n\n  -  a traffic flood resulting from a large number of users performing\n    TAU/RAU or from frequent transitions between idle and connected mode;\n\n  -  an exceptional event locally generating a traffic spike, e.g. a large\n    amount of calls (and dedicated bearers) being setup almost\n    simultaneously upon a catastrophic event or an exceptional but\n    predictable event (e.g. Christmas, New year) via a 3GPP access or a\n    WLAN access;\n\n  -  Frequent RAT-reselection due to scattered non-3GPP (e.g. WiFi)\n    coverage or massive mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP coverage may\n    potentially cause frequent or massive intersystem change activities,\n    i.e. UEs trying to either create  PDN connections over the new access\n    or moving PDN connections between 3GPP and non-3GPP coverage.\n\nBesides, GTP-C load balancing based only on semi-static DNS weights can\nlead to a load imbalance and thus GTP-C signalling scenarios, such as those\nmentioned above, may result in an overload of the SGWs or PGWs with the\nhighest load while there is still remaining capacity on other SGWs or PGWs.\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Load & overload control concepts", "numbering": "12.1.3", "title_level": 2, "desc": "12.1.3 Load & overload control concepts\n\nLoad control refers to \"GTP-C signalling based Load Control\" as defined in\nsubclause 4.3.7.1a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP\nTS 23.060 [35].\n\nOverload control refers to \"GTP-C signaling based Overload Control\" as\ndefined in subclause 4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause\n5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].\n\nLoad control and overload control are two distinct but complementary\nconcepts:\n\n  -  load control enables a GTP-C entity (e.g. an SGW/PGW) to send its load\n    information to a GTP-C peer (e.g. an MME/SGSN, ePDG, TWAN) to\n    adaptively balance the session load across entities supporting the same\n    function (e.g. an SGW cluster) according to their effective load.

Hence, the PGW\n    handling \"consumer\" APN sessions may be at higher risk of overload, as\n    compared to the other PGWs in the network, and hence, this situation\n    may result in poor overload control of the network.\n\n  3) To ensure an efficient node selection algorithm: Based on the node\n    level load information, the source node, (e.g. the MME) may end-up\n    selecting the PGW for a new session for the given APN. However, the\n    selected PGW may reject the new session request, if it is running at\n    100% load capacity for the given APN, or the new session request may be\n    throttled by the source node based on the overload information of the\n    APN for the given PGW. Thus the new session request may be denied,\n    (i.e. rejected by the selected PGW or throttled by the source node\n    based on PGW's APN level overload information) while the other PGW may\n    have the capacity to handle the same. Thus, the lack of APN level load\n    information may result in inefficient node selection algorithm by the\n    source node.\n\n\n"}, {"key": "Elements of APN load control", "numbering": "12.2.4.3", "title_level": 3, "desc": "12.2.4.3 Elements of APN load control\n\nTo allow for an effective APN load control, at least the following\ninformation (in addition to the other applicable information for load\ncontrol as defined in clause 12.2.5.1.2) is required to be advertised by\nthe PGW, as part of the APN level load information:\n\nAPN: The APN for which the PGW wants to advertise the load information.\n\nAPN-Load-Metric: It indicates the current resource utilization for a\nparticular APN, as a percentage, compared to the total resources reserved\nfor that APN at the target PGW. Its computation is implementation dependent\nand it has same characteristics as \"Load-Metric\", as described in clause\n12.2.5.1.2.2, when applied at the APN level.\n\nAPN-relative-capacity: It indicates the total resources configured for a\ngiven APN, compared to the total resources of the target PGW, as a\npercentage. It is a static parameter and does not change unless the\nresources configured for the APN change. Using APN-relative-capacity and\nthe DNS weight-factor of the given PGW, the source node can judge the PGW's\nAPN related resources as compared other PGWs in the network, i.e. the PGW's\nAPN-weight-factor can be calculated by multiplying the APN-relative-\ncapacity and DNS-weight-factor of the PGW (PGW's-APN-weight-factor = PGW's-\nAPN-relative-capacity X DNS-weight-factor).\n\nFor the following example configuration:\n\n   PGW1-APN1-relative-capacity = 50%; PGW2-APN1- relative-capacity = 20%;\nPGW3-APN1- relative-capacity = 10%\n\n   PGW1-weight-factor = 20; PGW2-weight-factor = 20; PGW3-weight-factor =\n60;\n\nThe APN level weight-factor for each of the PGWs can be calculated as\nbelow:\n\n  PGW1-APN1-weight-factor = 50% X 20 = 10.\n\n  PGW2-APN1-weight-factor = 20% X 20 = 4.\n\n  PGW3-APN1-weight-factor = 10% X 60 = 6.\n\nThus, based on the APN-weight-factor it can be concluded that the PGW1 has\nhighest APN1 related resources reserved, as compared to the other PGWs in\nthe network.

However, the exact\n    internal processing logics of a GTP-C entity will not be standardized;\n\n  i) for the inter-PLMN case, local configuration may restrict the exchange\n    and use of Overload Control Information across PLMNs;\n\n  j) the GTP-C entity may decide to send different values of Overload\n    Control Information on inter-network (roaming) and on intra-network\n    (non-roaming) interfaces based on local configuration, i.e. the values\n    sent on intra-network interfaces may differ from the values sent on\n    inter-network interfaces.
