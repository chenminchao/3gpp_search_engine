1  Scope

The present document specifies the stage 3 of the control plane of the GPRS
Tunnelling Protocol, Version 2 (GTPv2-C).

GTPv2-C shall be used over:

  -  the S2a, S2b, S3, S4, S5, S8, S10, S11, S16, Sm and Sn signalling
    interfaces in EPC, specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and
    3GPP TS 23.402 [45].

  -  the N26 signalling interface between EPC and 5GC, specified in
    3GPP TS 23.501 [82] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [83].

GTPv2-C based protocols shall also be used over the Sv (see 3GPP TS 29.280
[15]) and S101/S121 (see 3GPP TS 29.276 [14]) interfaces.

In this document, unless otherwise specified, the S2a, S2b, S5 and S8
interfaces refer to the GTP-based S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 interfaces
respectively.

The present document specifies functions, procedures and information which
apply to GERAN Iu mode. However, functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is
neither maintained nor enhanced.

3.1  Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given
in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
TR 21.905 [1].

GTP-PDU: GTP Protocol Data Unit is either a GTP-C Message or a GTP-U
Message. GTP-U Message may be either a signalling message across the user
plane tunnel, or a G-PDU (see clause 6).

  -  Signalling Message: any GTP-PDU (GTP-C or GTP-U) except the G-PDU.

  -  G-PDU: GTP user plane message, which carries the original packet
    (payload). G-PDU consists of GTP-U header and a T-PDU.

  -  T-PDU: original packet, for example an IP datagram, from an UE or a
    network node in an external packet data network. A T-PDU is the payload
    that is tunnelled in the GTP-U tunnel.

  -  GTP-C Message: GTP control plane message type of a GTP-PDU. GTP-C
    message consists of GTP-C header, which is followed by zero or more
    information elements.

  -  GTP-U Message: GTP user plane message. The user plane messages are
    used to carry user data packets, and also signalling messages e.g. for
    path management and error indication. Therefore, GTP-U message consists
    of GTP-U header, which is followed by either a T-PDU, or zero or more
    information elements.

GTP Tunnel: A GTP tunnel is a communication tunnel between two GTP nodes
(see subclause 4.1 "GTP Tunnel").

PDN Connection: "PDN Connection" in this specification only refers to the
PDN connection through the SGW and PGW.

SCEF PDN Connection: The PDN connection to the SCEF. Unless otherwise
indicated in a clause or subclause, "PDN Connections" do not refer to any
SCEF PDN Connection.

4  General


4.1  GTP Tunnel

GTP tunnels are used between two nodes communicating over a GTP based
interface, to separate traffic into different communication flows.

A GTP tunnel is identified in each node with a TEID, an IP address and a
UDP port number. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the
TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID value shall be
assigned in a non-predictable manner for PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b interfaces (see
3GPP TS 33.250 [85]). The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel
endpoints using GTP-C or S1-MME or Iu-PS messages. The GTPv2 entity
communicates to the peer GTPv2 entity the TEID value at which it expects to
receive all subsequent control plane messages related to that GTP tunnel
via the:

  -  "Sender F-TEID for Control Plane" IE,

  -  "PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based
    Control Plane interface" IE,

  -  "MSC Server Sv TEID for Control Plane" IE,

  -  "S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane" IE, or

  -  "MME/SGSN Sv TEID for Control Plane" IE.

The criteria defining when the same or different GTP tunnels shall be used
between the two nodes differs between the control and the user plane, and
also between interfaces.

For the control plane, for each end-point of a GTP-C tunnel:

  -  The TEID-C shall be unique per PDN-Connection on GTP based S2a, S2b,
    S5 and S8 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control
    messages related to all bearers associated to the PDN-Connection. A
    TEID-C on the S2a/S2b/S5/S8 interface shall be released after all its
    associated EPS bearers are deleted.

  -  There shall be only one pair of TEID-Cs per UE on each of the S3, S10,
    S16 and N26 interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control
    messages related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the
    S3/S10/S16/N26 interface shall be released after its associated UE
    context is removed or the UE is detached. For the S3 interface, when
    ISR is active for the UE, during I-RAT handover between the ISR
    associated nodes, the existing S3 TEID-C may be re-used or new S3 TEID-
    C may be allocated. During this scenario, if the node decides to
    allocate new S3 TEID-C, it shall release its own old S3 TEID-C.

  -  There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per UE over the S11 and the S4
    interfaces. The same tunnel shall be shared for the control messages
    related to the same UE operation. A TEID-C on the S11/S4 interface
    shall be released after all its associated EPS bearers are deleted.

  -  There shall be only one pair of TEID-C per MBMS Bearer Service (i.e.
    per TMGI and MBMS Flow Identifier, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is
    provided; or per TMGI, if the MBMS Flow Identifier is not provided)
    over the Sm and Sn interfaces respectively. The same tunnel shall be
    shared for the control messages related to the same MBMS Bearer
    Service. A TEID-C on the Sm/Sn interface shall be released after the
    MBMS Bearer Session is stopped.

For GTP-U, a TEID-U is used according to 3GPP TS 29.281 [13].

  NOTE:  GTP-U is based on GTP version 1 (GTPv1).


4.2  Protocol stack


4.2.0  General

The protocol stack for GTPv2 shall be as depicted in Figure 4.2.0-1.

                                    [pic]

                         Figure 4.2.0-1: GTPv2 stack

The GTPv2 headers are specified in the respective clauses of this
specification.

The source and destination IP addresses and UDP ports used for each GTP-C
message depend on the role that the message plays in a message exchange. A
message can be an Initial message, or a Triggered message, or a Triggered
Reply message to Triggered message. An Initial message is sent to a peer
GTP entity with a sequence number chosen by the sending entity (see
subclause 7.6). A Triggered message is sent in response to an Initial
message. Triggered Reply message may be sent in response to a Triggered
message. See subclause 7.6 for the sequence number usage.

Typically, a Request message is an Initial message, but a Request message
may be a Triggered messages in certain procedures where they are triggered
by an Initial Command message. See subclause 4.2.5 for classification of
the Initial messages and their possible Triggered messages, as well as
cases where there are Triggered Reply messages to the Triggered messages.

Piggybacking is an optional feature, which is described in Annex F of 3GPP
TS 23.401 [3]. If the feature is supported, then the piggybacking of the
initial messages on triggered response messages for EUTRAN Initial Attach,
a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN (see sub-
clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) and UE-requested PDN
Connectivity procedures shall be implemented as per requirements in
subclauses 4.2.0 and  5.5.1 of this specification  .When piggybacking is
used, a common IP header and a common UDP header shall be used for the
triggered response message and the piggybacked initial message as depicted
in Figure 4.2.0-2. Immediately following the triggered response message is
the piggybacked initial message, following which no additional information
shall be present. The subclause 5.5 specifies the usage of piggybacking-
specific fields in the GTP-C header.



|IP header   |UDP header  |Triggered response       |Piggybacked initial      |
|            |            |message (P=1)            |message (P=0)            |


       Figure 4.2.0-2: Packet Format for the Piggybacking of messages


4.2.1  UDP header and port numbers


4.2.1.0  General

A User Datagram Protocol (UDP) compliant with IETF RFC 768 [7] shall be
used.


4.2.1.1  Initial Messages

The UDP Destination Port number for GTPv2 Initial messages shall be 2123.
It is the registered port number for GTP-C.

The UDP Source Port for a GTPv2 Initial message is a locally allocated port
number at the sending GTP entity.

If GTPv2 and GTP' v2 modules are using the same IP address for sending
messages, the implementation shall ensure that while some source port
number is used by GTPv2 messages, the same source port number shall not be
used by GTP' v2 messages. Otherwise, the IP interface may have difficulty
to delivering a response message to the right protocol entity.


4.2.1.2  Triggered Messages

The UDP Destination Port value of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a
Triggered Reply message shall be the value of the UDP Source Port of the
corresponding message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the
case of the SGSN pool scenario.

The UDP Source Port of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered Reply
message shall be the value from the UDP Destination Port of the
corresponding message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the
case of the SGSN pool scenario.

In the SGSN pool scenario, if the Identification Request, the Context
Request or the Suspend Notification messages have been forwarded by another
SGSN in the pool, the UDP Destination Port for the Identification Response,
the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge message shall be determined
in the following way. The value from the information element "UDP Source
Port Number", which was sent in the corresponding forwarded request, shall
be copied into the UDP Destination Port field. The UDP Source Port for the
Identification Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge
message may be a locally allocated port number at the sending GTP entity.

In the handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed, if the Forward
Relocation Request message has been forwarded by the target MME, the UDP
Destination Port for the Forward Relocation Response shall be set to the
value of Source UDP Port Number IE included in the Forward Relocation
Request message; the UDP Source Port for the Forward Relocation Response
message may be a locally allocated port number at the sending GTP entity.


4.2.1.3  Piggybacked Messages

A piggybacked initial message is carried as a concatenation after a
triggered response message and they share a common UDP header (see Figure
4.2.0-2).

The UDP Destination port for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as
the port number used for the triggered response message.

The UDP Source port for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as
the port number used for the triggered response message.


4.2.2  IP header and IP addresses


4.2.2.1  Initial Messages

The IP Destination Address of a GTPv2 Initial message shall be an IP
address of the destination GTPv2 entity.

During the establishment of the GTP tunnel, the GTPv2 entity selects and
communicates to the peer GTPv2 entity the IP Destination Address at which
it expects to receive subsequent control plane Initial messages related to
that GTP tunnel via the:

  -  "Sender F-TEID for Control Plane" IE,

  -  "PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based
    Control Plane interface" IE,

  -  "MSC Server Sv Address for Control Plane" IE,

  -  "S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane" IE, or

  -  "MME/SGSN Sv Address for Control Plane" IE.

During the network triggered service restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS
23.007 [17]), if an MME/S4-SGSN sends a Downlink Data Notification Failure
Indication message to the SGW, then the destination address for this
message shall be the SGW IP address signalled via the Sender F-TEID for
Control Plane IE in the Downlink Data Notification message (if present in
the message), otherwise the source IP address of the Downlink Data
Notification message received earlier.

The IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Initial message shall be an IP address of
the source GTPv2 entity from which the Initial message is originating.


4.2.2.2  Triggered Messages

The IP Destination Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered
Reply message shall be copied from the IP Source Address of the message to
which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of the SGSN pool
scenario.

The IP Source Address of a GTPv2 Triggered message and for a Triggered
Reply message shall be copied from the IP destination address of the
message to which this GTPv2 entity is replying, except in the case of SGSN
pool scenario and handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed.

In the SGSN pool scenario, if the Identification Request, the Context
Request or the Suspend Notification messages have been forwarded by another
SGSN in the pool, the IP Source address for the Identification Response,
the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowledge messages shall be locally
allocated by the sending GTP entity. The IP Destination Address for the
Identification Response, the Context Response or the Suspend Acknowlegde
messages shall be determined in the following way. The value from the
information element "Address for Control Plane", which was sent in the
corresponding Identification Request or the Suspend Notification message;
or the value from the information element "S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for
Control Plane", which was sent in the corresponding Context Request
message, shall be copied into the IP Destination Address field.

In the handover scenario when the CIoT feature is deployed, if the Forward
Relocation Request message has been forwarded by the target MME, the IP
Source address of the Forward Relocation Response shall be locally
allocated by the sending GTP entity. The IP Destination Address field of
the Forward Relocation Response shall be set to the value of the "Sender's
F-TEID for Control Plane" IE received in the Forward Relocation Request
message.


4.2.2.3  Piggybacked Messages

A piggybacked initial message is carried as a concatenation after a
triggered response message and they share a common IP header (see Figure
4.2.0-2).

The IP Source Address for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as
the IP Address used for the triggered response message.

The IP Destination Address for the IP packet containing both the triggered
response message and the piggybacked initial message shall be the same as
the IP Address used for the triggered response message.


4.2.3  Layer 2

Typically Ethernet should be used as a Layer 2 protocol, but operators may
use any other technology.


4.2.4  Layer 1

Operators may use any appropriate Layer 1 technology.


4.2.5  Messages with GTPv2 defined replies: Classification of Initial and
         Triggered Messages

An Initial message is a GTPv2 message that is not triggered as a response
to another GTPv2 message across the given interface.

The expected reply to a Request message is a Triggered message and the
reply has the same message name as the Request but with "Response"
replacing "Request".

  NOTE 1:  If the SGW receives a "Create Session Request" on S11/S4, this
         can trigger either of the following GTPv2 messages across S5/S8:
         "Create Session Request" or "Modify Bearer Request". However,
         neither of these messages across S5/S8 is considered to be a
         Triggered message.

If a Request message is a reply to a Command message, then the Request
message is a Triggered message; otherwise the Request message is an Initial
message. Responses do not have replies except when a "Context Acknowledge"
is required as a reply to "Context Response" message as specified in
relevant Stage 2 procedures. Context Acknowledge is always triggered
message and does not have a reply.

  NOTE 2:  The "Context Acknowledge" message is sent only if the "Context
         Response" message is received with the acceptance cause.

A message whose name ends in "Command" is always an initial message. If a
"Command" message fails, the name of the reply message is constructed by
replacing "Command" with "Failure Indication". Apart from "Downlink Data
Notification Failure Indication" message, a "Failure Indication" is a
Triggered message. The "Failure Indication" message does not have a reply.
If a "Command" message is successful, its reply will be a Request as
specified in relevant Stage 2 procedures.

A message whose name ends in "Notification" is always an Initial message,
The expected Triggered message in reply has the same message name but with
"Acknowledge" replacing "Notification", except for the case of the message
"Downlink Data Notification" which has the reply "Downlink Data
Notification Acknowledge" and "PGW Resart Notification" which has the reply
"PGW Restart Notification Acknowledge". An "Acknowledge" message does not
have a reply.

CS Paging Indication, Stop Paging Indication, RAN Information Relay,
Configuration Transfer Tunnel, Trace Session Activation, Trace Session
Deactivation, ISR Status Indication and Downlink Data Notification Failure
Indication messages are Initial messages that do not have a reply.

A Version Not Supported Indication message is a Triggered message.


4.3  Transmission Order and Bit Definitions

The messages in this document shall be transmitted in network octet order
starting with octet 1 with the Most Significant Bit sent first.

The most significant bit of an octet in a GTP message is bit 8. If a value
in a GTP message spans several octets and nothing else is stated, the most
significant bit is bit 8 of the octet with the lowest number.


5  GTP Header for Control Plane


5.1  General format

Control Plane GTP uses a variable length header. Control Plane GTP header
length shall be a multiple of 4 octets. Figure 5.1-1 illustrates the format
of the GTPv2-C Header.

|       |  |Bits                                 |
|Octets |  |8   |7   |6   |5   |4   |3   |2   |1   |

|m to   |  |If T flag is set to 1, then TEID     |
|k(m+3) |  |shall be placed into octets 5-8.     |
|       |  |Otherwise, TEID field is not present |
|       |  |at all.                              |
|n to   |  |Sequence Number                      |

|(n+3)  |  |Spare                                |


       Figure 5.1-1: General format of GTPv2 Header for Control Plane

Where:

  -  if T = 0, TEID field is not present, k = 0, m = 0 and n = 5;

  -  if T = 1, TEID field is present, k = 1, m = 5 and n = 9.

The usage of GTPv2-C header across the EPC specific interfaces is defined
in the subclause 5.5 "Usage of the GTPv2-C Header". Octet 1 bits shall be
coded as follows:

  -  Bits 6-8 represent the Version field.

  -  Bit 5 represents the Piggybacking flag (P).

  -  Bit 4 represents the TEID flag (T).

  -  Bits 3-1 are spare, the sender shall set them to "0" and the receiving
    entity shall ignore them.


5.2  Control Plane GTP Extension Header

The legacy Extension Header mechanism is not used for the GTP version 2
control plane (GTPv2-C). Future extensions will be implemented by adding
Information Elements in the message body if new parameters are needed.


5.3  GTP-C header for Echo and Version Not Supported Indication messages

The GTPv2-C message header for the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version
Not Supported Indication messages shall not contain the TEID field, but
shall contain the Sequence Number fields, followed by one spare octet as
depicted in figure 5.3-1. The spare bits shall be set to zero by the sender
and ignored by the receiver. For the Version Not Supported Indication
message header, the Sequence Number may be set to any number and shall be
ignored by the receiver.

Apart from the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version Not Supported
Indication messages, the GTP-C message header shall contain the TEID and
Sequence Number fields followed by one spare octet. A typical GTP-C header
is depicted in figure 5.4-1. The spare bits shall be set to zero by the
sender and ignored by the receiver.

 Figure 5.4-1: The format of EPC specific GTPv2 Control Plane message Header


5.5  Usage of the GTPv2-C Header


5.5.1  General

The format of the GTPv2-C header is specified in subclause 5.1 "General
format". The usage of the GTP-C header across e.g. S101/S121 (3GPP TS
29.276 [14]) and Sv (3GPP TS 29.280 [15]) interfaces are defined in their
respective specifications.

The usage of the GTPv2-C header for EPC specific interfaces shall be as
defined below.

The first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:

  -  Bits 8 to 6, which represent the GTP-C version, shall be set to
    decimal 2 ("010").

  -  Bit 5 represents a "P" flag. If the "P" flag is set to "0", no
    piggybacked message shall be present. If the "P" flag is set to "1",
    then another GTPv2-C message with its own header and body shall be
    present at the end of the current message.

    When present, a piggybacked message shall have its "P" flag set to "0"
    in its own header. If a Create Session Response message (as part of
    EUTRAN initial attach, a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP
    Access to E-UTRAN (see sub-clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402
    [45]) or UE-requested PDN connectivity procedure) has the "P" flag set
    to "1", then a single Create Bearer Request message shall be present as
    the piggybacked message. As a response to the Create Bearer Request
    message, if the Create Bearer Response has the "P" flag set to "1",
    then a single Modify Bearer Request (as part of EUTRAN initial attach,
    a Handover from Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP IP Access to E-UTRAN (see
    sub-clauses 8.6 and 16.11 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]) or UE-requested PDN
    connectivity procedure) shall be present as the piggybacked message. A
    Create Bearer Response with "P" flag set to "1" shall not be sent
    unless a Create Session Response with "P" flag set to "1" has been
    received for the same procedure. Apart from Create Session Response and
    Create Bearer Response messages, all the EPC specific messages shall
    have the "P" flag set to "0".

  -  Bit 4 represents a "T" flag, which indicates if TEID field is present
    in the GTP-C header or not. If the "T" flag is set to 0, then the TEID
    field shall not be present in the GTP-C header. If the "T" flag is set
    to 1, then the TEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in
    octets 5 to 8. Apart from the Echo Request, Echo Response and Version
    Not Supported Indication messages, in all EPC specific messages the
    value of the "T" flag shall be set to "1".

  -  Bit 3  represents a "MP" flag. If the "MP" flag is set to "1", then
    bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the message priority.

  -  Bit 2 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to "0" and the
    receiving entity shall ignore it.

  -  Bit 1 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to "0" and the
    receiving entity shall ignore it.

The usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified
below.

  -  Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the
    unique value for each type of control plane message. Message type
    values are specified in Table 6.1-1 "Message types for GTPv2".

  -  Octets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall
    indicate the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory
    part of the GTP-C header (the first 4 octets). The TEID (if present)
    and the Sequence Number shall be included in the length count. The
    format of the Length field of information elements is specified in
    subclause 8.2 "Information Element Format".

  -  A piggybacked initial message and the preceding triggered response
    message present in the common IP/UDP packet shall have their own length
    and sequence number in their respective GTP-C headers. The overall
    length of the IP/UDP packet shall indicate the total length of the two
    GTP-C messages.

  -  For EPC specific interfaces, T=1, and therefore octets 5 to 8
    represent the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID) field. This field shall
    unambiguously identify a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP-C entity.
    The Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is set by the sending entity in the GTP
    header of all control plane messages to the TEID value provided by the
    corresponding receiving entity (see subclause 4.1). If a peer's TEID is
    not available the TEID field shall be present in a GTPv2-C header, but
    its value shall be set to "0", as specified in subclause 5.5.2
    "Conditions for sending TEID=0 in GTPv2-C header".

  NOTE:  The TEID in the GTP header of a Triggered (or Triggered Reply)
         message is set to the TEID value provided by the corresponding
         receiving entity regardless of whether the source IP address of the
         Initial (or Triggered) message and the IP Destination Address
         provided by the receiving entity for subsequent control plane
         Initial messages (see subclause 4.2.2.1) are the same or not.

  -  Octets 9 to 11 represent GTP Sequence Number field.

  -  Bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 shall indicate the relative priority of the
    GTP-C message, if the "MP" flag is set to 1 in Octet 1. It shall be
    encoded as the binary value of the Message Priority and it may take any
    value between 0 and 15, where 0 corresponds to the highest priority and
    15 the lowest priority.

    If the "MP" flag is set to "0" in Octet 1, bits 8 to 5 of octet 12
    shall be set to "0" by the sending entity and ignored by the receiving
    entity.

  -  Bits 4 to 1 of octet 12 are spare bits. The sending entity shall set
    them to "0" and the receiving entity shall ignore them.


5.5.2  Conditions for sending TEID=0 in GTPv2-C header

If a peer's TEID is not available, the TEID field still shall be present in
the header and its value shall be set to "0" in the following messages:

  -  Create Session Request message on S2a/S2b/S5/S8

  -  Create Session Request message on S4/S11, if for a given UE, the
    SGSN/MME has not yet obtained the Control TEID of the SGW.

  -  Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message on S4/S11, if
    the SGW selected by the MME/S4-SGSN for indirect data forwarding is
    different from the SGW used as anchor.

  -  Identification Request/Response messages.

  -  Forward Relocation Request message over the S10, S16 and N26
    interfaces, and over the S3 interface during I-RAT handover when ISR is
    not active.

  -  Forward Relocation Request message over the S3 interface during I-RAT
    handover between ISR associated nodes, when ISR is active for the UE,
    and if the node decides to allocate new S3 TEID-C.

  -  Context Request message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26 interfaces.

  -  Relocation Cancel Request message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26
    interfaces, except for the case where the old SGSN/MME or AMF has
    already been assigned the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane of
    the new SGSN/MME or AMF.

  -  Relocation Cancel Response message over the S10, S16, S3 and N26
    interfaces if the new SGSN/MME or AMF does not have the Tunnel Endpoint
    Identifier Control Plane of the old SGSN/MME or AMF.

  -  Delete PDN Connection Set Request/Response messages.

  -  Configuration Transfer Tunnel message.

  -  RAN Information Relay message.

  -  If a node receives a message and the TEID-C in the GTPv2 header of the
    received message is not known, it shall respond with "Context not
    found" Cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the
    TEID used in the GTPv2-C header in the response message shall be then
    set to zero.

  -  If a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g.
    Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message
    as specified in clause 7.7, it shall reject the request message. For
    the response message, the node should look up the remote peer’s TEID
    and accordingly set the GTPv2-C header TEID and the message cause code.
    As an implementation option, the node may not look up the remote peer’s
    TEID and set the GTPv2-C header TEID to zero in the response message.
    However in this case, the cause code shall not be set to "Context not
    found".

  -  MBMS Session Start Request message.

  -  PGW Restart Notification / PGW Restart Notification Acknowledge
    messages.

  -  Downlink Data Notification message sent on S11/S4 as part of the
    Network Triggered Service Restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.007
    [17]), and corresponding Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge and
    Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication if the SGW did not
    include the Sender F-TEID for Control Plane IE in the Downlink Data
    Notification message.

  -  Stop Paging Indication message is sent to the the restarted CN node
    (or another node in the same pool) as part of the Network Triggered
    Service Restoration procedure with ISR (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]).

  -  Suspend Notification and Suspend Acknowledge messages: over S16
    interface; over S3 interface when ISR is not active.

  -  PGW Downlink Triggering Notification message on S5 and S11/S4, PGW
    Downlink Triggering Acknowledge message on S11/S4, and PGW Downlink
    Triggering Acknowledge message on S5 if the PGW did not include the
    Sender F-TEID for Control Plane IE in the PGW Downlink Triggering
    Notification message.

  -  UE Registration Query Request and UE Registration Query Response
    messages over S3 interface.

  NOTE:  Legacy implementation conforming to earlier versions of this
         specification can send the Change Notification Request/Response
         messages on the TEID zero in spite of the peer’s node TEID being

         6  GTP-C Message Types and Message Formats


6.0  General

A GTP-C message is sent across a GTP control plane tunnel. In a message,
the GTP-C header is followed by zero or more information elements. The GTP-
C messages are used for the control plane path management, for the control
plane tunnel management and for mobility management.

A T-PDU is an original packet, for example an IP datagram, from an UE, or
from a network node in an external packet data network.

  Editor's Note: Whether an MME may initiate an Identification Request
         procedure towards an AMF during 5GS to EPS idle mode mobility using
         an Attach request is FFS. The AMF does not initiate an
         Identification Request procedure towards an MME during EPS to 5GS
         idle mode mobility.


6.1.1  Presence requirements of Information Elements

There are four different presence requirements (Mandatory, Conditional,
Optional, or Conditional-Optional) for an IE within a given GTP-PDU:

  -  Mandatory means that the IE shall be included by the sending side, and
    that the receiver diagnoses a "Mandatory IE missing" error, when
    detecting that the IE is not present. A response including a "Mandatory
    IE missing" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.

  -  Conditional means:

    -  that the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions
       specified in the relevant protocol specification are met;

    -  the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the
       corresponding message type description, based on the parameter
       combination in the message and/or on the state of the receiving node,
       to infer if a conditional IE shall be expected. Only if a receiver
       has sufficient information the following applies. A conditional IE,
       which is absolutely necessary for the receiving entity to complete
       the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort the
       procedure.

  -  Conditional-Optional means:

    -  that the IE shall be included by the up-to-date sending entity, if
       the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are
       met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and
       therefore is not up-to-date, obviously cannot send such new IE.

    -  the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message.
       If the receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE,
       then the IE's absence shall not trigger any of the error handling
       procedures. The handling of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be
       treated as Optional IEs as specified in subclause 7.7 "Error
       Handling".

  -  Optional means:

    -  that the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE
       may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent
       optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in subclause
       7.7 "Error Handling".

For conditional IEs, the clause describing the GTP-PDU explicitly defines
the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or
optional for that particular GTP-PDU. These conditions shall be defined so
that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is
critical for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other
protocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.

For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow
the rules:

  -  The grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence
    requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the
    Mandatory grouped IE for the given message.

  -  The grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded
    IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is
    viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the
    grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as
    Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is
    Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver.

  -  The grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the
    embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this
    embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If
    the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this
    embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded
    IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as
    Optional IE by the receiver.

  -  The grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in
    the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.

In all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in
subclause 7.7 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.

Only the Cause information element at message level shall be included in
the response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request
is not accepted regardless of whether there are other mandatory or
conditional information elements defined for a given response message.

The following are exceptions:

  -  Optionally, the Protocol Configuration Options, Recovery, User
    Location Information (ULI), Load Control Information, Overload Control
    Information, Bearer Context and Local Distinguished Name (LDN)
    information elements may be included.

  -  For the rejection response of a Forward Relocation Request, the
    Forward Relocation Response message may also include an F-Cause IE as
    specified in clause 7.3.2.

  -  For the rejection response of a SRVCC PS to CS Request, the SRVCC PS
    to CS Response message may also include an SRVCC Cause IE as specified
    in clause 5.2.3 in 3GPP TS 29.280 [15].

  -  A Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge (with or) without an
    indication of success may also include a DL low priority traffic
    Throttling IE and the IMSI IE.

  -  The PGW Back-Off Time IE may also be returned when rejecting a Create
    Session Request with the cause "APN Congestion".

  -  Change Notification Response message may also include the IMSI and MEI
    information elements.

  -  Failure Indication type messages do not have "Accept" types of Cause
    values, i.e. all used values indicate the rejection, therefore for
    Failure Indication type of triggered messages, other information
    elements, other than the Cause IE, shall also be included according to
    the conditions of presence specified in the respective message, if they
    are available.

  -  The Context Response message (sent by an SGSN or MME) should also
    include the IMSI IE if the Cause IE contains the value "P-TMSI
    Signature mismatch", except if the UE is emergency attached and the UE
    is UICCless.

  -  The Create Bearer Response message, the Update Bearer Response message
    and the Delete Bearer Response message shall include the RAN/NAS Cause
    IE according to the conditions specified in subclauses 7.2.4, 7.2.16
    and 7.2.10.2.

  -  The UE Registration Query Response message shall include IMSI to allow
    the SGSN to correlate the response message with the corresponding
    request.

If the Cause information element at Grouped IE level contains a value that
indicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, e.g. "Context Not
Found" at Bearer Context IE level, the other information elements in this
Grouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.


6.1.2  Grouped Information Elements

Information elements can contain other IEs. This type of IE is called
"Grouped IEs".

Grouped IEs have a length value in the TLIV encoding, which includes the
added length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped
information element with 4 octets long IE header is defined in subclause
8.2 "Information Element Format". Each information element within a grouped
IE also shall also contain 4 octets long IE header.

Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE
type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall
explicitly state if it is grouped.

  NOTE 1:  Each entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit
         from the grouped IE closes the scope level. The GTPv2 message level
         is the top most scope. This is analogous to the local scope of a
         subroutine/function.

If more than one grouped information elements of the same type, but for a
different purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have different
Instance values.

If more than one grouped information elements of the same type and for the
same purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have exactly the same
Instance value to represent a list.

  NOTE 2:  For instance, all "Bearer Contexts Modified" IEs of the type
         "Bearer Context" in a "Modify Bearer Response" message shall have
         the Instance value of 0, while all "Bearer Contexts Marked for
         Removal" IEs of the type "Bearer Context" in the same message shall
         have the Instance value of 1.


6.1.3  Information Element instance

Every GTPv2 message and grouped IE within a message in this specification
has a column documenting the instance value of each IE.

When a GTPv2 message is encoded for use the instance value of each included
IE is encoded in the Instance field of the IE for the message scope. See
clause 7 and subclause 8.2 for details of that encoding.

An Information Element in an encoded GTPv2 message or encoded grouped IE is
identified by the pair of IE Type and Instance values and described by a
specific row in the corresponding tables in subclauses of 7 in the present
document.

If several Information Elements with the same Type and Instance values are
included in an encoded GTPv2 message, they represent a list for the
corresponding IE name and row identified in the message grammar in
subclauses of clause 7.

If several Information Elements with the same Type and Instance values are
included in an encoded grouped IE, they represent a list for the
corresponding IE name and row identified in the grouped IE grammar in
subclauses of clause 7.

In tables in this document the instance value for "Private Extension" is
marked as VS (Vendor Specific). While an instance value must be encoded by
the sender the value can be Vendor and even Private Extension specific.

The same IE name might be used in different messages (on the top level or
within grouped IEs) in this specification. The instance value and name of
an IE is only meaningful within the scope of the message definition . The
combination of Type value and Instance value uniquely identifies a specific
row in a message description table.


6.2  Message Granularity

The GTPv2-C messages shall be sent per UE on the S3, S10, S16 and N26
interfaces.

The GTPv2-C messages shall be sent per PDN-Connection on the S2a, S2b, S4,

7.1.2  Echo Response

Table 7.1.2-1 specifies the information elements included in the Echo
Response message.

The Recovery information element contains the local Restart Counter, which
is specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17])

The optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific
information.

            Table 7.1.2-1: Information Elements in Echo Response

|Information  |P |Condition / Comment                 |IE Type    |Ins|

|Features     |  |node on any GTPv2 interface if the  |Features   |   |
|             |  |sending node supports at least one  |           |   |
|             |  |feature on this interface or if the |           |   |
|             |  |sending node supports at least one  |           |   |
|             |  |feature and does not know the       |           |   |
|             |  |interface type towards the peer     |           |   |
|             |  |node. This IE may be present        |           |   |

|Extension    |  |                                    |Extension  |   |


  NOTE:     Having no Cause IE in the Echo Response message is an
         exceptional case for a triggered message. Hence, a GTP entity that
         detects a GTP protocol error, e.g Mandatory IE missing, in the Echo
         Request message, ignores the IE(s) that are in error and sends Echo
         Response. In addition it can log the error.


7.1.3  Version Not Supported Indication

This message contains only the GTPv2 header and indicates the latest GTP
version that the sending entity supports.


7.2  Tunnel Management Messages


7.2.0  General

A node shall include the Recovery information element if it is in contact
with the node's peer for the first time, or if the node or the node's peer
has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been
indicated to the peer. The peer receiving the Recovery information element
shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall
consider the rest of the message in accordance with the message semantics
and parameters.

    3GPP TS 23.161 [71].

If the new Create Session Request received by the SGW collides with an
existing active PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context
is identified with the tuple [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID], where IMSI shall be
replaced by TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency attached UE
without UICC or authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be
treated as a request for a new session. Before creating the new session,
the SGW should delete:

  -  the existing PDN connection context locally, if the Create Session
    Request is received with the TEID set to zero in the header, or if it
    is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header and it collides
    with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;

  -  the existing dedicated bearer context locally, if the Create Session
    Request collides with an existing dedicated bearer context and the
    message is received with a TEID not set to zero in the header.

In the former case, if the PGW S5/S8 IP address for control plane received
in the new Create Session Request is different from the PGW S5/S8 IP
address for control plane of the existing PDN connection, the SGW should
also delete the existing PDN connection in the corresponding PGW by sending
a Delete Session Request message.

  NOTE 1:  The SGW can send the Create Session Request and Delete Session
         Request over S5/S8 asynchronously, e.g. the SGW can send the Delete
         Session Request and then the Create Session Request without having
         to wait for the Delete Session Response. It does not matter if the
         PGW happens to receive the Delete Session Request after the Create
         Session Request since the PGW assigns a different S5/S8 F-TEID for
         control plane to the new PDN connection.

If the new Create Session Request received by the PGW collides with an
existing PDN connection context (the existing PDN connection context is
identified with the triplet [IMSI, EPS Bearer ID, Interface type], where
applicable Interface type here is S2a TWAN GTP-C interface or S2b ePDG GTP-
C interface or S5/S8 SGW GTP-C interface, and where IMSI shall be replaced
by TAC and SNR part of ME Identity for emergency attached UE without UICC
or authenticated IMSI), this Create Session Request shall be treated as a
request for a new session. Before creating the new session, the PGW should
delete:

  -  the existing PDN connection context, if the Create Session Request
    collides with the default bearer of an existing PDN connection context;

  -  the existing dedicated bearer context, if the Create Session Request
    collides with a dedicated bearer of an existing PDN connection context.

The PGW shall allocate a new PGW S5/S8 F-TEID for control plane to the new
PDN connection, i.e. not the same F-TEID value as the one which was
assigned to the existing PDN connection.

  NOTE 2:  With GTP based S2a and S2b, the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for
         specific UE over S2a between the TWAN and PGW and over S2b between
         an ePDG and PGW are independent of the EPS Bearer IDs assigned for
         the same UE over S5/S8 and may overlap in value (see 3GPP TS 23.402
         [45] subclause 4.6.2).

  NOTE 3:  Only the TAC and SNR part of the ME Identity is used to identify
         an emergency attached UE without UICC or authenticated IMSI.

|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |
|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |
|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |
|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |
|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |
|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |
|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |
|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |
|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |
|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |
|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |
|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |

|(identified by this IE which carries the Origin-Host and Origin-Realm|
|included in the DEA message received by the ePDG/TWAN over SWm or STa|
|interface) for establishing the S6b session.                         |
|NOTE 14: Before contacting an EPC entity, e.g. to send a Create      |
|Session Request message, the MME/SGSN shall ensure, during the       |
|selection procedure, that the receiving entities support Non-IP PDN  |
|type, as specified in subclause 5.9 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32], e.g.     |
|using the Notification of Supported features procedure to learn if   |
|the candidate SGW supports the CIOT feature. See also the subclause  |

|NOTE 15: An MME, SGW and PGW which supports NB-IoT and/or Non-IP PDN |
|type and/or inter-system change with 5GS shall support ePCO. A UE    |
|supporting NB-IoT access and/or Non-IP PDN type and/or N1 mode also  |
|support ePCO.                                                        |
|NOTE 16: All the UE's SGi PDN Connections shall either have the      |
|Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indication set or not set.         |
|NOTE 17: If the APN was authorized based on the wildcard APN, the    |
|Selection Mode Value shall be set to indicate that the subscription  |
|is not verified, see Annex A of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].                 |
|NOTE 18: The MME can set the Control Plane Only Indication only      |
|during a PDN connection creation procedure, and the Serving PLMN Rate|
|Control is only applicable to the PDN connection with Control Plane  |
|Only Indication set.                                                 |
|During an inter MME with SGW relocation procedure, when the source   |
|MME has not set the Control Plane Only Indication, and the target MME|
|supports only the Control Plane CIoT Optimizations, then the target  |
|MME shall not include the Serving PLMN Rate Control IE as the PDN    |
|connection cannot be changed to Control Plane Only.                  |
|During an inter MME with SGW relocation procedure, when the source   |
|MME has set the Control Plane Only Indication and included Serving   |
|PLMN rate control IE in the Context Response message, and the target |
|MME supports both the Control Plane CIoT Optimisation and the        |
|establishment of the User Plane, the target MME cannot stop the      |
|Serving PLMN Rate Control, i.e. the PGW will continue to enforce     |
|Serving PLMN Rate Control as the Control Plane Only Indication for   |
|this PDN connection cannot be changed during this mobility procedure.|
|NOTE 19: An MME which supports eNB Change Reporting shall also       |
|support Change reporting and therefore shall set both the Change     |
|Report Supporting indication and the eNB Changing Reporting Support  |
|Indication.                                                          |
|NOTE 20: Upon inter MME/SGSN mobility, the target MME/SGSN shall     |
|report Presence Reporting Area Information for all the active and    |
|inactive PRAs requested by the PGW. Upon intra MME/SGSN mobility with|
|SGW relocation, the MME/SGSN shall only report active PRAs whose     |
|Presence Reporting Area Information is changed, e.g. from inside to  |
|outside, or vice versa.                                              |
|NOTE 21: This information is used for the SGW-U, PGW-U or combined   |

|NOTE 1: According to 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] e.g. subclause 5.5.1.2.2     |
|"S1-based handover, normal" and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], during the      |
|handover procedure with an SGW change, except in the case of         |
|X2-handover (NOTE2 addresses X2 based HO with SGW change case), the  |
|target MME/S4-SGSN initiates the Create Session Request/Response and |
|Modify Bearer Request/Response procedures one after the other. After |
|receiving the "Bearer Context to be Created" IEs within Create       |
|Session Request message, the SGW may not accept some of these        |
|bearers. The SGW however shall return all bearers with the "Bearer   |
|Context Created" IEs within Create Session Response message (this    |
|table), but with different Cause values. Bearers that were not       |
|accepted by the SGW shall have an appropriate rejection value in the |
|Cause IE. The target MME/S4-SGSN shall send these non-accepted       |
|bearers to the target SGW within the "Bearer Context to be removed"  |
|IE in a subsequent Modify Bearer Request message. Therefore, the SGW |
|shall allocate the DL S5/S8 SGW F-TEIDs also for the non-accepted    |
|bearers. MME/S4-SGSN should remove all of the non-accepted bearers by|
|separate procedures (e.g. an MME/S4-SGSN initiated Dedicated Bearer  |
|Deactivation procedure).                                             |
|NOTE 2: According to 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] subclause 5.5.1.1.3,         |

|using S4", during the X2-handover procedure with an SGW change and   |
|Enhanced Serving RNS Relocation Procedure with an SGW change, the    |
|target MME/S4-SGSN shall initiate only the Create Session            |
|Request/Response procedure. The SGW shall return all bearers         |
|(including those not accepted by the SGW) with a "Bearer Context     |
|Created" IE within Create Session Response message (this table), but |
|with different Cause values. Bearers that were not accepted by the   |
|SGW shall have an appropriate rejection value in the Cause IE, The   |
|MME/S4-SGSN should remove these non-accepted bearers by separate     |
|procedures as well.                                                  |
|NOTE 3: According to 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] e.g. subclause 5.3.3.1       |
|"Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change" and 3GPP TS  |
|23.060 [35], during the RAU/TAU procedure with an SGW change, the    |
|target MME/S4-SGSN shall initiate only the Create Session            |
|Request/Response procedure. The SGW shall return all bearers         |
|(including those not accepted by the SGW) with a "Bearer Context     |
|Created” IE within Create Session Response message (this table), but |
|with different Cause values. Bearers that were not accepted by the   |
|SGW shall have an appropriate rejection value in the Cause IE. When  |
|Active Flag or Follow-on request is set during TAU/RAU procedure,    |
|MME/S4-SGSN should not establish user plane tunnel over S1 or Iu for |
|those bearer contexts which were not accepted by the target SGW,     |
|while in the corresponding Modify Bearer Request message, the        |
|MME/S4-SGSN shall include all accepted bearer contexts in the "Bearer|
|Context to be modified" IE and include all non-accepted bearer       |
|contexts in the "Bearer Context to be removed" IE.  The MME/S4-SGSN  |
|should remove the bearers non-accepted by either SGW or eNB/RNC by   |
|separate procedures as well.                                         |
|NOTE 4: The capability to receive from the LMA an alternate LMA      |
|address for user plane shall be supported homogeneously across all   |
|the SGWs, when supported over PMIP-based S5/S8.                      |
|NOTE 5: For PMIP based S5/S8, the 'S5/S8-U PGW F-TEID' IE and the    |
|'PGW S5/S8/ S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based |

|PGW PMIPv6 interface).                                               |
|NOTE 6: When Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization is supported, the IP|
|address spaces for S1-U and S11-U may be different, based on         |
|operator's deployment. If so, the following requirements shall apply:|
|                                                                     |
|1) if the CPOPCI (Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indication) flag |
|is not set in the Create Session Request message, the SGW shall      |
|include both the S11-U SGW F-TEID and S1-U SGW F-TEID in the Create  |
|Session Response message, regardless of whether the S11-U Tunnel flag|
|is set in the Create Request Request.                                |
|2) all the MMEs in the PLMN shall support receiving both the S11-U   |
|SGW F-TEID and S1-U SGW F-TEID in the Create Session Response        |
|response; the MME shall use them according to whether the CIoT       |
|Control Plane Optimization is used.                                  |

|NOTE 1: The SGW shall use the same F-TEID IP address and TEID values |
|for S1-U, S4-U and S12 interfaces. However, when sending a Create    |
|Bearer Request message to an S4-SGSN for a UE in idle mode, the SGW  |
|can not know whether the S4-SGSN will establish a direct user plane  |
|tunnel between the RNC and the SGW. The SGW may include either the   |
|S4-U SGW F-TEID IE or the S12 SGW F-TEID IE in the Create Bearer     |
|Request message. The S4-SGSN will decide whether to establish a      |
|direct user plane tunnel or not and will provide accordingly either a|
|S12 RNC F-TEID or a S4-U SGSN F-TEID in the Create Bearer Response   |
|message, where the interface type of the provided F-TEID may differ  |
|from the interface type of the SGW F-TEID used for bearer            |
|correlation, e.g. if the SGW includes the S4-U SGW F-TEID in the     |
|Create Bearer Request message, and if the SGSN decides to use Direct |
|Tunnelling, the S4-SGSN shall provide the S12 RNC F-TEID in the      |
|Create Bearer Response message, together with S4-U SGW F-TEID. The   |
|SGW should not treat this as an error.                               |
|NOTE 2:  The TWAN does not exchange signalling with the 3GPP AAA     |
|Server nor with the UE in this procedure. The TWAN may include an    |
|internal failure cause for the bearer creation failure. The protocol |
|type used to encode the internal failure cause is implementation     |
|specific.                                                            |

7.2.5  Bearer Resource Command

A Bearer Resource Command message shall be sent from a MME to a SGW and
forwarded to PGW as a part of the UE requested bearer resource allocation
procedure or UE requested bearer resource modification procedure (which is
used also for a dedicated bearer deactivation) , as specified by 3GPP TS
24.301 [23].

The message shall also be sent on the S4 interface by a SGSN to a SGW and
on the S5/S8 interface by a SGW to a PGW as part of the MS initiated PDP
Context modification procedure, or secondary PDP context activation
procedure.

The message shall also be sent on the S11/S4 interface by an MME/S4-SGSN to
a SGW and on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by a SGW or a TWAN/ePDG to a
PGW as part of the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedure and the UE
requested IP flow mapping procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].

Table 7.2.5-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

  NOTE:  Depending on the protocol type on the S5/S8 interface, the SGW or
         the PGW will determine if the UE is requesting an
         Allocation/Modification operation of bearer resources for a traffic
         flow aggregate based on the TFT operation code and the packet
         filter ID value in the Traffic Aggregate (TAD) IE and/or the
         presence of the EPS Bearer ID IE.

7.2.6  Bearer Resource Failure Indication

A Bearer Resource Failure Indication shall be sent by the PGW to an SGW and
forwarded to the MME to indicate failure of the UE requested bearer
resource allocation procedure or UE requested bearer resource modification
procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 24.301 [23].

The message shall also be sent by a PGW to an SGW and forwarded to an SGSN
as part of the failure of an MS initiated PDP Context modification
procedure or secondary PDP context activation procedure.

The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by a PGW
to a SGW or to a TWAN/ePDG and the S11/S4 interface by a SGW to an MME/S4-
SGSN as part of the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedure and the UE
requested IP flow mapping procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].

Table 7.2.6-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  - "Semantic error in the TAD operation".

  - "Syntactic error in the TAD operation".

  - "Semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

  - "Syntactic errors in packet filter(s)".

  - "Collision with network initiated request".

  - "Service denied".

  -  "Bearer handling not supported".

  -  "UE context without TFT already activated".

  -  PGW Pause of Charging procedure

and on the S2b interface by the ePDG to the PGW as part of the procedures:

If the optional network triggered service restoration feature is supported
by the MME, SGSN and SGW, then the Modify Bearer Request message shall also
be sent as part of the network triggered service restoration procedure with
ISR during an intra MME TAU and an intra S4-SGSN RAU procedure for UEs that
had ISR active before either the MME or the S4-SGSN has restarted, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]:

  -  on the S11 interface by the MME to the SGW, if the MME detected that
    the ISR associated S4-SGSN has restarted and UE performs a TAU
    procedure;

  -  on the S4 interface by the S4-SGSN to the SGW, if the S4-SGSN detected
    that the ISR associated MME has restarted and UE performs a RAU
    procedure.

This message can be used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in
the SGW and in the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] sections 6.2.2.1 and
6.3.2.1, 3GPP TS 23.272 [21] sections 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4). A Modify Bearer
Request used as an implicit resume can contain zero or more IE(s),
depending on the conditions of presence of the IEs specified in table 7.2.7-
1. The PGW should not consider a Modify Bearer Request with zero IE as an
error.

The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases
from the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User
CSG Information or/and UE Time Zone which occured during a previous RAU
procedure without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the
SGW/PGW, or to indicate to the PGW that the UE is available for signalling
if the PDN connection is delay tolerant and if there is pending network
initiated PDN connection signalling:

  -  during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for
    the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U
    tunnel;

  -  when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid
    LLC frame serving as a paging response from a UE in GERAN with an
    existing S4-U tunnel.

The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent in the following cases
from the S4-SGSN to the SGW/PGW to report a change of User Location
Information which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN
change but which has not been reported yet to the SGW/PGW, if the S4-SGSN
is configured to defer the reporting of ULI change until a RAB/user plane
is established:

  -  during a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for
    the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN with an existing S4-U
    tunnel;

  -  when the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid
    LLC frame serving as a paging response for a UE in GERAN with an
    existing S4-U tunnel.

  NOTE 1:  the S4-SGSN can alternatively send a Change Notification Request
         message in the above cases, if no other information which requires
         the sending of a Modify Bearer Request, needs to be reported to the
         PGW.

The Modify Bearer Request message may also be sent by the MME to the
SGW/PGW to report a change of Serving Network, User Location Information,
User CSG Information, UE Time Zone or/and RAT Type, when user data is
transported in NAS signalling, for a UE with an existing S11-U tunnel.

When requesting the PGW to pause or unpause charging for a PDN connection,
the SGW shall wait for the PGW acknowledgement (i.e. Modify Bearer
Response) before sending a new pause or unpause request.

  NOTE 2:  this ensures that the PGW always act per the most recent SGW
         request in particular in scenarios where the SGW would need to
         request the PGW to pause and unpause charging in a row (or vice-
         versa) and the Modify Bearer Request messages would arrive out of
         order at the PGW.

Upon receipt of a request from the PGW/PCRF/OCS in a message other than
Create Bearer Request and Update Bearer Request to report changes of UE
presence in new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s), the MME/S4-SGSN
shall immediately send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change
Notification Request message to report to the PGW whether the UE is inside
or outside the new or modified Presence Reporting Area(s) or whether the
Presence Reporting Area(s) is inactive.

The MME/S4-SGSN shall also send a Modify Bearer Request message or a Change
Notification Request message to report any subsequent change of UE presence
in the Presence Reporting Area, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP
TS 23.060 [35].

If the Modify Bearer Request message is sent from the old MME/SGSN as part
of Tracking/Routeing Area Update procedure with SGW change and data
forwarding as specified in subclause 5.3.3.1A of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], the
old MME/SGSN shall only include the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE.

  NOTE 3:  Since the UE has left the old MME/SGSN, some information related
         to the UE, e.g. ULI, UE Time Zone, CSG, RAT Type in the old
         MME/SGSN are not valid any more.

Upon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Presence
Reporting Area Information from the MME/S4-SGSN, the SGW shall send a
Modify Bearer Request message on the S5/S8 interface if any of the
following condition is met:

  -  ISR is not active;

  -  ISR is active, and the RAT Type has changed since last reported or the
    CPRAI flag has been set to 1.

The MME shall increment the "MO Exception data counter" by one each time
the MME has received the RRC cause "MO Exception data". The MME may defer
sending a Modify Bearer Request message to report a non-zero value for the
MO Exception Data Counter based on local configuration.

Upon receipt of a Modify Bearer Request message that includes the Secondary
RAT Usage Data Report from the MME, the SGW shall send a Modify Bearer
Request message on the S5/S8 interface if the IRPGW flag is set to 1 in the
Secondary RAT Usage Data Report IE.

|NOTE1:  This requirement is introduced for backwards compatibility   |
|reasons. If Bearer Contexts to be modified IE(s) is received in the  |
|Modify Bearer Request message, the PGW shall include corresponding   |
|Bearer Contexts modified IE(s) in the Modify Bearer Response message.|
|NOTE2: According to the description in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] e.g.       |
|subclause 5.3.3.1 "Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW    |
|change" and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], during a TAU/RAU/Handover procedure |
|with an SGW change, if the SGW receives 'Bearer Context to be        |
|removed' IEs, the SGW shall allocate the S5/8-U SGW F-TEID for those |
|bearers and include also these bearers in the 'Bearer contexts to be |
|modified' IE, which is then sent within this message on the S5/S8    |
|interface to the PGW.                                                |
|NOTE3: The 'Bearer Contexts to be removed' IE signals to the SGW that|
|these bearers will be removed by the MME/SGSN later on by separate   |
|procedures (e.g. MME/S4-SGSN initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation |
|procedure). Therefore, the SGW will not delete these bearers during  |
|the ongoing TAU/RAU/Handover procedure (without an SGW change), a    |
|Handover procedure (with an SGW change except for an X2-Handover), an|
|UE initiated Connection Resume and a Service Request procedure.      |
|NOTE 4:  3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (e.g. subclause 5.3.2.1) and 3GPP TS     |
|23.060 [35] (e.g. subclause 9.2.2.1) defines the MME/SGSN shall send |
|the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the PGW. In such  |
|case MME/SGSN shall use the Change Reporting Support Indication      |
|and/or CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (whichever is         |
|applicable), even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting      |
|Support Indication.                                                  |
|NOTE 5: In TAU/RAU procedure, if the UE requested to activate E-RAB  |
|for all the active EPS bearers in TAU procedure or to keep the Iu    |
|connection after the completion of the RAU procedure, the User       |
|Location Info/User CSG Information/UE Time Zone/Presence Reporting   |
|Area Information shall not be sent in S1-U GTP-U tunnel setup        |
|procedure during the TAU procedure when the "active flag" is set (see|
|3GPP TS 24.301 [23] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]) or in the Service Request|
|procedure after the completion of the RAU procedure.                 |
|NOTE 6: 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] specifies that the target MME/SGSN (for a |
|handover with MME/SGSN change and with or without SGW change) and the|
|MME/SGSN (for a handover without MME/SGSN change and with SGW change)|
|shall send the Modify Bearer Request message to the SGW in the S1    |
|based handover/ Inter RAT handover for an unaccepted PDN Connection  |
|when at least one PDN Connection of the UE was accepted by the RAN.  |
|In this case, the (target) MME shall indicate the reserved IP address|
|to the SGW in the S1 eNodeB F-TEID and the (target) SGSN shall       |
|indicate the reserved IP address to the SGW in the S12 RNC F-TEID for|
|all the non GBR bearers of the unaccepted PDN Connection in the      |
|Bearer Contexts to be modified IE. An implementation may provide the |
|mentioned reserved IP address e.g. from one of the reserved IP       |
|address ranges (see RFC5735 or                                       |
|http://www.iana.net/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space|
|.xml), or the IP address may be provisioned by a configuration. The  |
|(target) MME/SGSN shall indicate all the GBR bearers of the          |
|unaccepted PDN connection in the Bearer Contexts to be removed IE.   |
|NOTE 7: This IE is sent on S11/S4 in the specified conditions        |
|regardless of whether the H(e)NB local IP address and UDP port number|
|information has changed or not to enable the SGW to propagate this IE|
|in Modify Bearer Request over S5/S8 when required for reasons other  |
|than reporting a change in the H(e)NB local IP address and UDP port  |
|number information.                                                  |
|NOTE 8: H(e)NB local IP address and UDP port number information      |
|changes when the UE moves from an (e)NB to an H(e)NB, or from one    |
|H(e)NB to another H(e)NB with a change in the fixed network backhaul,|
|or from one H(e)NB to a (e)NB.                                       |
|The SGW shall send a Modify Bearer Request on S5/S8 if any of the    |
|following condition is met:                                          |
|a) the Propagate BBAI Information Change flag is received from the   |
|MME/SGSN;                                                            |
|b) ISR is active and the RAT type has changed.                       |
|NOTE 9: When ISR is active, the CLII and CPRAI flags allow the SGW to|
|avoid sending Modify Bearer Request message over S5/S8 interface     |
|during UE-initiated Service Request procedure, when the ULI IE and/or|
|the Presence Reporting Area Information IE is included over S11/S4   |
|Modify Bearer Request message but the location information and/or the|
|Presence Reporting Area information and the RAT Type has not changed |
|since last reported by the SGW.                                      |
|NOTE 10: The RAU/TAU/Handover procedure which requires an SGW        |
|selection for the first time, e.g. a Gn/Gp SGSN to an S4 SGSN/MME    |
|RAU/TAU/Handover procedure, shall be handled in a similar manner to  |
|the RAU/TAU/Handover with an SGW change procedure.                   |
|NOTE 11: The Bearer Context to be modified IE and Bearer Context to  |
|be removed IE, together, shall contain all the bearers belonging to  |
|the given PDN connection with each bearer appearing in only one of   |
|these IEs. See subclause 14 for the cases when a Bearer Context      |
|mismatch is detected.                                                |
|NOTE 12: The conditions of presence of the IEs in the Modify Bearer  |
|Request for the MME and S4-SGSN triggered Serving GW relocation (see |
|subclause 5.10.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause 9.2.2.4 of 3GPP |
|TS 23.060 [35]) are identical to those specified respectively for X2 |
|handover with SGW relocation and for Enhanced Serving RNS Relocation |
|with SGW relocation.                                                 |
|NOTE 13: If this flag is set in the message, the PGW shall not       |
|interpret the absence of other IEs (e.g. MME-FQ-CSID, H(e)NB Local IP|
|Address) as bearing any significance. The message may contain either |
|the PDN Pause On Indication or the PDN Pause Off Indication, not     |
|both.                                                                |
|NOTE 14: During the TAU/RAU/Handover from Gn/Gp SGSN, the target     |
|MME/S4-SGSN can not derive the level of support for User Location    |
|Change Reporting and/or CSG Information Change Reporting at the      |
|source Gn/Gp SGSN.                                                   |
|NOTE 15: In shared networks, when the message is sent from the VPLMN |
|to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in this IE shall be   |
|that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or    |
|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |
|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |
|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |
|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |
|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |
|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |
|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |
|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |
|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |
|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |
|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |
|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |
|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |
|NOTE 16: If the UE initiates a TAU or RAU procedure back to the old  |
|MME/old S4 SGSN before completing the ongoing TAU or RAU procedure   |
|and the UE is not accessed via a CSG cell or hybrid cell, the old    |
|MME/old S4-SGSN shall treat this case as the UE leaves a CSG or      |
|hybrid cell.                                                         |
|NOTE 17: The MME/S4-SGSN may be configured to defer the reporting of |
|ULI change until an E-RAB, RAB or user plane is established. In that |
|case, the MME/S4-SGSN shall not send a Modify Bearer Request, unless |
|this is required for other reasons, during TAU/RAU without MME/SGSN  |
|change or Service Request (for UTRAN) procedures not requesting to   |
|activate data radio bearer(s). For GERAN, the SGSN shall defer the   |
|reporting of ULI changes, if so configured in the SGSN, until receipt|
|of an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as |
|a paging response.                                                   |
|The MME/S4-SGSN shall report ULI changes as soon as detected if it is|
|not configured to defer the reporting of ULI changes until an E-RAB, |
|RAB or user plane is established, or if an E-RAB, RAB or user plane  |
|is established.                                                      |
|NOTE 18: During an Inter-MME/SGSN and Intra-SGW mobility procedure,  |
|if the SGW detects that the support of ePCO has changed, e.g. when   |
|the source MME supports ePCO while the target MME does not support   |
|it, the SGW shall trigger a Modify Bearer Request without setting the|
|EPCOSI flag if the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent due to  |
|other reasons. The PGW shall interpret that ePCO is not supported for|
|this PDN Connection.                                                 |
|NOTE 19: The MME/SGSN or SGW reporting this indication to the PGW    |
|during an inter-PLMN procedure does not trigger any extra signalling.|
|                                                                     |
|NOTE 20: The MME can set the Control Plane Only Indication only      |
|during a PDN connection creation procedure, and the Serving PLMN Rate|
|Control is only applicable to the PDN connection with Control Plane  |
|Only Indication set.                                                 |
|During an inter MME without SGW relocation procedure, when the source|
|MME has not set the Control Plane Only Indication, and the target MME|
|supports only the Control Plane CIoT Optimizations, then the target  |
|MME shall not include the Serving PLMN Rate Control IE as the PDN    |
|connection cannot be changed to Control Plane Only.                  |
|During an inter MME without SGW relocation procedure, when the source|
|MME has set the Control Plane Only Indication and included Serving   |
|PLMN rate control IE in the Context Response message, and the target |
|MME supports both the Control Plane CIoT Optimisation and the        |
|establishment of the User Plane, the target MME cannot stop the      |
|Serving PLMN Rate Control, i.e. the PGW will continue to enforce     |
|Serving PLMN Rate Control as the Control Plane Only Indication for   |
|this PDN connection cannot be changed during this mobility procedure.|
|NOTE 21: An MME which supports eNB Change Reporting shall also       |
|support Change reporting and therefore shall set both the Change     |
|Report Supporting indication and the eNB Changing Reporting Support  |
|Indication.                                                          |
|NOTE 22: Upon inter MME/SGSN mobility, the target MME/SGSN shall     |
|report Presence Reporting Area Information for all the active and    |
|inactive PRAs requested by the PGW. Upon intra MME/SGSN mobility, the|
|MME/SGSN shall only report active PRAs whose Presence Reporting Area |
|Information is changed, e.g. from inside to outside, or vice versa.  |
|                                                                     |
|NOTE 23: The PGW may use the IMSI or the MEI to verify if the Modify |
|Bearer Request message is received for the right UE context. In some |
|error scenarios, e.g. when a delete bearer request (to delete a PDN  |
|connection) is lost over S5/S8, the PGW can receive the Modify Bearer|
|Request message for the hanging PDN connection from the MME/SGSN and |
|SGW, if the PGW has reassigned the F-TEID of the hanging PDN         |
|connection for another UE.                                           |
|NOTE 24: The eNB Change Reporting feature should be supported        |
|homogeneously across all MMEs in the network. Otherwise the PGW would|
|not be notified about the change of support of eNB Change Reporting  |
|when the UE moves from an MME supporting eNB Change Reporting to an  |
|MME that does not support eNB Change Reporting.                      |
|NOTE 25: This information is used for the SGW-U selection (see Annex |
|B.2 of 3GPP TS 29.244 [80]).                                         |

|             |  |supports both IP address types, the |           |   |
|             |  |MME shall send both IP addresses    |           |   |
|             |  |within an F-TEID IE. If only one IP |           |   |

|             |  |See NOTE 8.                         |           |   |
|NOTE 1: If only EPS Bearer ID IE is included in the Bearer Context to|
|be modified IE during the TAU/RAU without SGW change procedure, the  |
|SGW shall remove the stored SGSN/RNC/eNodeB/MME userplane F-TEID     |
|locally.                                                             |
|NOTE 2: When Direct Tunnel is used in 3G, e.g. during a Service      |
|Request procedure if the UE requests to establish a partial set of   |
|radio access bearers and if the SGSN accepts it, or during an SRNS   |
|relocation procedure with some bearer contexts being preserved, the  |
|SGSN shall provide EBI(s) without S12 RNC F-TEID(s) for these bearer |
|context(s) without corresponding radio access bearer(s) being        |
|established. The SGW shall be able to handle these bearer context(s).|
|However, in earlier releases this behaviour may not be supported by  |
|the SGW and hence for such SGW, the SGSN shall provide EBI together  |
|with S12 RNC F-TEID for each of the bearer context(s) in the Bearer  |
|Context to be modified IE.                                           |
|NOTE 3: It is not possible to establish or release a partial set of  |
|radio access bearers in E-UTRAN. The MME shall provide in the Bearer |
|Contexts to be modified IE, for a UE entering or being in CONNECTED  |
|state, the EBI together with the S1 eNodeB F-TEID for all the bearers|
|of the PDN connection affected by the Modify Bearer Request other    |
|than those possibly indicated in the Bearer Context to be removed IE.|
|NOTE 4: When the PCO-based extension of the HSS based P-CSCF         |
|restoration for 3GPP access is supported as specified in subclause   |
|5.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.380 [61], the MME shall store the S1 eNodeB      |
|F-TEID(s) of the IMS PDN connection for UEs with an IMS PDN          |
|connection in ECM-CONNECTED state, so that the MME can include all   |
|the S1 eNodeB F-TEID(s) of the IMS PDN connection for such a UE in   |
|ECM-CONNECTED state in the Modify Bearer Request message.            |
|NOTE 5: When the PCO-based extension of the HSS based P-CSCF         |
|restoration for 3GPP access is supported as specified in subclause   |
|5.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.380 [61], the S4-SGSN shall store the S12 RNC    |
|F-TEID(s) (if Direct Tunneling is used) for all the bearers of the   |
|IMS PDN connection with corresponding radio access bearers           |
|established, for UEs with an IMS PDN connection in PMM-CONNECTED     |
|state, so that the S4-SGSN can include all the S4-U SGSN F-TEID(s)   |
|(if Direct Tunneling is not used) or S12 RNC F-TEID(s) (if Direct    |
|Tunneling is used) for all the bearers of the IMS PDN connection with|
|corresponding radio access bearers established, for such a UE in     |
|PMM-CONNECTED state in the Modify Bearer Request message.            |
|NOTE 6: During a TAU/RAU with SGW change procedure and data          |
|forwarding of DL data buffered in the old SGW (see subclause 5.3.3.1A|
|of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]), the old MME/SGSN shall provide the old SGW   |
|with the Forwarding F-TEID received in the Context Acknowledge       |
|message (or in the SGSN Context Acknowledge message when a Gn/Gp SGSN|
|is involved) and encode it as either an:                             |
|- eNB F-TEID for a PDN connection not established with the CPOPCI    |
|flag set to 1 (for an old MME),                                      |
|- S11-U MME F-TEID for a PDN connection established with the CPOPCI  |
|flag set to 1 (for an old MME), or                                   |
|- S12 RNC F-TEID or S4-U SGSN F-TEID (for an old SGSN),              |
|regardless of the interface type set in the F-TEID received from the |
|new MME/SGSN. This is to make the downlink data forwarding appear as |
|a regular downlink data transmission for the old SGW, i.e. like a    |
|Service Request procedure.                                           |
|NOTE 7: In the Establishment of S1-U bearer during Data Transport in |
|Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation procedure (see subclause 5.3.4B.4|
|of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]), the MME may send a Modify Bearer Request to  |
|the SGW, to request the establishment of the S1-U bearers, without   |
|sending a prior Release Access Bearers Request to tear down the S11-U|
|bearers. In this case, the MME shall encode the bearers being        |
|switched from S11-U to S1-U in the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE |
|and the SGW shall release the S11-U bearers upon receipt of the      |
|Modify Bearer Request requesting the establishment of the S1-U       |
|bearers.                                                             |
|NOTE 8: All the SGi PDN connections of a UE in E-UTRAN shall either  |

7.2.8  Modify Bearer Response

The Modify Bearer Response message shall be sent on the S11/S4 interfaces
by the SGW to the MME/S4-SGSN, on the S5/S8 interfaces by the PGW to the
SGW and on the S2b interface by the PGW to the ePDG as part of the
procedures listed for the Modify Bearer Request (see subclause 7.2.7).

If the MME has sent the counter for the RRC Cause "MO Exception data" in
the Modify Bearer Resquest, the MME shall reset the counter value when
receiving the Modify Bearer Response message.

If handling of default bearer fails, then Cause at the message level shall
be a failure cause.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  -  "Request accepted".

  -  "Request accepted partially".

  -  "Context not found".

  -  "Service not supported".

The direction of this message shall be from MME/S4-SGSN to SGW, from SGW to
PGW and from TWAN/ePDG to PGW (see Table 6.1-1).

A Delete Session Request message shall be sent on the S11 interface by the
MME to the SGW and on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW for a UE
having at least one PDN connection through the SGW and PGW, as part of the
procedures:

  -  EUTRAN Initial Attach

  -  UE, HSS or MME Initiated Detach

  -  UE or MME Requested PDN Disconnection

The message shall also be sent on the S2b interface by the ePDG to the PGW
as part of procedures:

  -  UE/ePDG Initiated Detach with GTP on S2b

  -  UE Requested PDN Disconnection with GTP on S2b

  -  HSS/AAA Initiated Detach with GTP on S2b

The message shall also be sent on the S2a interface by the TWAN to the PGW
as part of procedures:

  -  UE/TWAN Initiated Detach and UE/TWAN Requested PDN Disconnection in
    WLAN on GTP S2a

  -  HSS/AAA Initiated Detach in WLAN on GTP S2a

This message may also be sent on S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW:

  -  If Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge message with Context not
    found cause value is received.

During the detach procedure, if ISR is active and SGW receives a Delete
Session Request, the SGW shall deactivate the ISR.

  NOTE:  The SGW can determine if it is a detach procedure based on e.g. it
         receives a Delete Session Request message for the last PDN
         Connection.

When ISR is active, during the Detach procedure the SGW shall forward the
Delete Session Request message to the PGW on the S5/S8 interface after
receiving both of the messages sent from the MME and the SGSN for the same
PDN Connection.

If there are any procedure collisions, the Delete Session Request shall
have precedence over any other Tunnel Management message.

During the handover procedure the Delete Session Request message shall not
release the indirect data forwarding tunnels.

Possible Cause values are:

  -  "ISR deactivation ".

  -  "Network Failure".

  -  "QoS parameter mismatch".

Table 7.2.9.1-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

|received.                                                            |
|NOTE 2: Following an inter RAT TAU/RAU failure, the target MME/SGSN  |
|may mistakenly initiate the implicit detach procedure while the UE is|
|managed by the other MME/SGSN. In this case, the SGW will reject the |
|Delete Session Request message with the cause "Invalid peer".        |
|NOTE 3:  If the UE has multiple PDN connections and only one of these|
|is being deactivated, the MME/S4-SGSN shall not send the Cause IE    |
|with the value "ISR deactivation".                                   |
|NOTE 4:  If ISR is active, after receiving both the Delete Session   |
|Request messages from the MME and the SGSN, the SGW shall include the|
|most recent ULI timestamp and the related User Location Information  |
|in the Delete Session Request message on S5/S8 interface.            |
|NOTE 5: The conditions of presence of the IEs in the Delete Session  |
|Request for the MME and S4-SGSN triggered Serving GW relocation (see |
|subclause 5.10.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause 9.2.2.4 of 3GPP |
|TS 23.060 [35]) are identical to those specified respectively for X2 |
|handover with SGW relocation and for Enhanced Serving RNS Relocation |
|with SGW relocation.                                                 |
|NOTE 6: In some scenarios, e.g. during an S11/S4 path failure, the   |
|old SGW may send a Delete Session Request towards the PGW for a PDN  |
|connection which has already been relocated to a new SGW.  In this   |
|case, the PGW shall reject the Delete Session Request message with   |
|the cause "Invalid peer".                                            |
|NOTE 7: In shared networks, when the message is sent from the VPLMN  |
|to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in this IE shall be   |
|that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or    |
|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |
|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |
|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |
|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |
|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |
|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |
|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |
|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |
|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |
|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |
|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |
|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |
|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |
|NOTE 8: This IE corresponds to the TWAN Release Cause IE specified in|
|3GPP TS 23.402 [45].                                                 |
|NOTE 9: An NB-IFOM capable MME/SGSN remains unaware of whether the   |
|PDN connection to be released is associated with multiple accesses or|
|not (i.e. whether this is a NB-IFOM PDN connection).                 |
|NOTE 10: During an inter-MME/SGSN and intra SGW mobility procedure,  |
|if the Modify Bearer Request message from the target MME/SGSN arrives|
|at the SGW before the Delete Session Request message from the source |
|MME/SGSN, and if the Sender F-TEID for the Control Plane was included|
|in the Delete Session Request, this would lead the SGW to reject the |
|Delete Session Request message.                                      |

7.2.9.2  Delete Bearer Request

The direction of this message shall be from PGW to SGW, from SGW to MME/S4-
SGSN and from PGW to TWAN/ePDG (see Table 6.1-1).

A Delete Bearer Request message shall be sent on the S5/S8 and S4/S11
interfaces as part of the following procedures:

  -  PGW or MME initiated bearer deactivation procedures,

  -  UE requested Bearer Resource Modification,

  -  MS and SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure using S4 or

  -  PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure using S4.

In the above cases, this Request is sent by the PGW to the SGW and shall be
forwarded to the MME or S4-SGSN.

The message shall also be sent on the S4/S11 interface by the SGW to the
SGSN/MME to delete the bearer resources on the other ISR associated CN node
if the ISRAI flag is not set in the Modify Bearer Request/Modify Access
Bearers Request message.

The message shall also be sent on the S4/S11 interface by the SGW to the
SGSN/MME to delete the bearer resources on the other ISR associated CN node
in the TAU/RAU/Handover procedures if the ISR related Cause IE is included
in the Delete Session Request message.

The message shall also be sent on the S2b interface by the PGW to the ePDG
as part of PGW Initiated Bearer Resource Allocation Deactivation procedure
with GTP on S2b.

The message shall also be sent on the S2a interface by the PGW to the TWAN
as part of the PGW Initiated Bearer Resource Allocation Deactivation in
WLAN on GTP on S2a procedure.

The message may also be sent on the S11/S4 interface by the SGW to the
MME/S4 SGSN when the SGW receives the Error Indication from PGW for the
default bearer or the ICMP message from a PGW that indicates the UE
specific error indication as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].

The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 or S2a/S2b interface by the PGW
to the SGW or to the TWAN/ePDG and on the S11/S4 interface by the SGW to
the MME/S4-SGSN as part of the Network-initiated IP flow mobility
procedure, as specified by 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].

If the UE uses NB-IoT, WB-EUTRAN or GERAN Extended Coverage with increased
NAS transmission delay (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]),
the MME/SGSN should proceed as specified for a UE in ECM-IDLE state with
extended idle mode DRX enabled in subclause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].

Possible Cause values are:

  -  "RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP",

  -  "ISR deactivation",

  -  "Access changed from Non-3GPP to 3GPP",

  -  "Reactivation requested",

  -  "PDN reconnection to this APN disallowed",

  -  "PDN connection inactivity timer expires",

  -  "Local release",

  -  "Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed".

Table 7.2.9.2-1 specifies the presence of IEs in this message.

7.2.11 Downlink Data Notification messages


7.2.11.1 Downlink Data Notification

A Downlink Data Notification message shall be sent:

  -  on the S11 interface by the SGW to the MME as a part of the network
    triggered service request procedure;

  -  on the S4 interface by the SGW to the S4-SGSN as part of Paging with
    no established user plane on S4, SGW triggered paging with S4;

  -  on the S4 interface by the SGW to the S4-SGSN to re-establish all the
    previous released bearer(s) for a UE, upon receipt of downlink data for
    a UE in connected mode but without corresponding downlink bearer
    available;  

  NOTE:  This may occur e.g. if the S4-SGSN releases some but not all the
         bearers of the UE as specified in subclause 12.7.2.2 of 3GPP TS
         23.060 [35].

  -  on S11/S4 interface by SGW to MME/S4-SGSN if the SGW has received an
    Error Indication (see 3GPP TS 29.281 [13]) from eNodeB/RNC/MME across
    S1-U/S12/S11-U interface. Respective SGW and MME/S4-SGSN functionality
    is specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].

  -  on the S11/S4 interface by SGW to the MME/S4-SGSN as part of the
    network triggered service restoration procedure if both the SGW and the
    MME/S4-SGSN support this optional feature (see 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]).

  -  on the S11 interface by the SGW to the MME as a part of the Mobile
    Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation with P-
    GW connectivity.

  A Downlink Data Notification message may be sent:

  -  on the S4 by the SGW to the S4-SGSN if the SGW has received an Error
  Indication from S4-SGSN across S4-U interface.

Table 7.2.11.1-1 specifies the presence of the IEs in the message.

|NOTE 2:  In this version of the specification, the MME/S4-SGSN shall |
|set the header TEID value in subsequent Downlink Data Notification   |
|Acknowledge or/and Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication to  |
|that of the SGW’s Control Plane TEID if the Sender F-TEID for Control|
|Plane IE is present in the Downlink Data Notification message.       |
|However the SGW shall be prepared to receive messages in which the   |
|header TEID value is set to zero from implementation conforming to   |
|earlier versions of this specification. When that is the case, the   |
|receiver identifies the subscriber context based on the included IMSI|
|IE.                                                                  |
|NOTE 3: For PMIP based S5/S8, if the SGW cannot derive the EPS bearer|
|ID/ARP from the control plane signalling (received over Gxx          |
|interface) the SGW should use the corresponding PDN connection’s (for|
|which the control plane signalling is received) default EPS bearer’s |
|EPS bearer ID/ARP.                                                   |
|NOTE 4:  Upon receiving a downlink data packet for a Non-IP PDN      |
|connection (see subclause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]), the Paging   |
|and Service Information shall not be included in the Downlink Data   |

7.2.11.3 Downlink Data Notification Failure Indication

A Downlink Data Notification Failure indication shall be sent from an
MME/SGSN to a SGW indicating that the UE did not respond to paging. It
shall also be sent in the case that the UE responded to the page with a
Service Request but that the MME has rejected the request by sending a
Service Reject to the UE. It may happen, for example, because the requested
service is not supported or there is a bearer context mismatch.

This message should not be used after an MME/SGSN successfully receives the
Service Request message from the UE in the Network Triggered Service
Request procedure as defined in the 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].

  NOTE:  Either the Modify Bearer Request message or the Delete Bearer
         Command message is used by the MME/SGSN to indicate a possible
         failure case after an MME/SGSN successfully receives the Service
         Request message from the UE.

Possible Cause values are:

  - "UE not responding".

  - "Service denied".

  - "UE already re-attached".

7.2.14 Modify Bearer Command and Failure Indication


7.2.14.1    Modify Bearer Command

The Modify Bearer Command shall be sent on the S11 interface by the MME to
the SGW and on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as part of the HSS
Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification procedure, or when the SQCI flag or
the PSCI flag is set to 1 in the Context Response message.

It shall also be sent on the S4 interface by the SGSN to the SGW and on the
S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW as part of the HSS Initiated
subscribed QoS modification procedure, or when the SQCI flag or the PSCI
flag is set to 1 in the Context Response message.

When deferred reporting of subscription change procedure is homogenously
supported by MMEs and SGSNs in the serving network, the MME shall defer
sending Modify Bearer Command if the related UE is not reachable by the
MME, e.g. when the UE is suspended, when the UE has entered into power
saving mode or when the PPF is cleared in the MME, until the UE becomes
reachable again as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].

  NOTE:  SGSNs do not defer the reporting of subscription change but need
         to support reporting the subscription change when receiving the
         PSCI flag in the Context Response message.

It shall also be sent on the S2a/S2b interface by the TWAN/ePDG to the PGW
as part of the HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification procedure.

7.2.16 Update Bearer Response

An Update Bearer Response shall be sent from a MME/SGSN to a SGW and
forwarded to the PGW, and from TWAN/ePDG to the PGW as a response to an
Update Bearer Request message.

Table 7.2.16-1 specifies the presence requirements and the conditions of
the IEs in the message.

Cause IE indicates if an EPS bearer has been modified in the
MME/SGSN/TWAN/ePDG or not. The EPS Bearer has not been modified in the
MME/SGSN/TWAN/ePDG if the Cause IE value differs from "Request accepted" or
"Request accepted partially". Possible Cause values are specified in Table
8.4-1. Message specific cause values are:

  - "Request accepted".

  - "Request accepted partially"

  - "Context not found"

  - "Semantic error in the TFT operation".

  - "Syntactic error in the TFT operation".

  - "Semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

  - "Syntactic errors in packet filter(s)".

  -  "Denied in RAT".

  -  "UE refuses".

  - "Unable to page UE".

  - "UE not responding".

  - "Unable to page UE due to Suspension".

  - "Temporarily rejected due to handover/TAU/RAU procedure in progress".

  - "MME/SGSN refuses due to VPLMN Policy".

  - "UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving"

|message, e.g. when Direct Tunnel is used in 3G and the UE is in IDLE |

|F-TEID. The SGW shall be able to handle these bearer context(s).     |
|However, in earlier releases this behaviour may not be supported by  |
|the SGW and hence for such an SGW, in order to be backward           |
|compatible, the SGSN shall provide EBI(s) together with either the   |

7.2.17.2 Delete Bearer Failure Indication

A Delete Bearer Failure Indication shall be sent on the S5/S8 interface by
the PGW to the SGW and on the S11 interface by the SGW to the MME as part
of failure of eNodeB requested bearer release or MME Initiated Dedicated
Bearer Deactivation procedure.

The message shall also be sent on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to the SGW
and on the S4 interface by the SGW to the SGSN as part of failure of MS and
SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure using S4.

This message shall be sent back if none of the bearers (not even a single
one) included in the Delete Bearer Command message could be deleted.

The Cause IE indicates that the EPS bearer has not been deleted in the PGW.


When the SGW receives a Delete Bearer Failure Indication message from the
PGW with the TEID set to zero in the GTPv2 header and the Cause IE is set
to "Context Not Found", which implies that the PDN connection does not
exist in the PGW, the SGW may send a Delete Bearer Request message to
delete the PDN connection towards the MME/SGSN after sending the Delete
Bearer Failure Indication message.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  - "Context not found"

|NOTE 1:  The SGW which is hosting the UE's bearer(s) is considered as|
|the (local) anchor point. Unlike the PGW, the SGW may change due to  |
|mobility between eNodeBs, or E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN supported with  |
|S4 based architecture. In these cases the new SGW where the UE's     |
|bearer(s) are moved, becomes the new local anchor point. A source    |
|MME/SGSN may select an SGW for indirect data forwarding which is     |
|different than the source (anchor) SGW. Similarly, a target MME/SGSN |
|may select an SGW for indirect data forwarding which is different    |
|than the target (anchor) SGW.                                        |

7.2.19 Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response

A Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response message shall be sent by
the SGW to the MME/SGSN as a response to a Create Indirect Data Forwarding
Tunnel Request message.

Table 7.2.19-1 specifies the presence requirements and the conditions of
the IEs in the message.

The Cause value indicates if the Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnels has been
created in the SGW or not. No Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnels have been
created in the SGW if the Cause differs from "Request accepted" or "Request
accepted partially". Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.
Message specific cause values are:

  - "Request accepted".

  - "Request accepted partially".

  - "Data forwarding not supported".

  - "Context not found".

7.2.21 Release Access Bearers Request

The Release Access Bearers Request message shall be sent on the S11
interface by the MME to the SGW as part of the S1 release procedure and
eNodeB initiated Connection Suspend procedure.

It may also be sent on the S11 interface by the MME to the SGW as part of
the Establishment of S1-U bearer during Data Transport in Control Plane
CIoT EPS optimisation procedure (see subclause 5.3.4B.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401
[3]).

  NOTE:  The S1 release procedure is also used to release the S11-U bearers
         for the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, except in the case of
         data buffering in the MME.

The message shall also be sent on the S4 interface by the SGSN to the SGW
as part of the procedures:

  -  RAB release using S4

  -  Iu Release using S4

  -  READY to STANDBY transition within the network

7.2.24 Modify Access Bearers Request

The direction of this message shall be from MME to SGW (see Table 6.1-1).

If both the SGW and the MME support the MABR feature (see subclause 8.83),
an MME may send a Modify Access Bearer Request message on the S11 interface
to an SGW as part of the following procedures:

  -  UE triggered Service Request if there is no suspended bearer for that
    UE,

  -  S1-based Handover without SGW relocation,

  -  X2-based handover without SGW relocation,

  -  Inter-MME E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without SGW Change,

  -  Intra-MME E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without SGW Change with Active
    Flag;

  -  E-UTRAN Initiated E-RAB modification procedure

  -  Mobile Originated Data transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS
    optimisation with P-GW connectivity

  -  Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS
    optimisation with P-GW connectivity

  -  Connection Resume procedure (see subclause 5.3.5A of 3GPP TS 23.401
    [3])

  -  Establishment of S1-U bearer during Data Transport in Control Plane
    CIoT EPS optimisation procedure (see subclause 5.3.4B.4 of 3GPP TS
    23.401 [3]).

  if all the following conditions are fulfilled:

  - the RAT type has not changed;

  - the Serving Network has not changed;

  - the MME does not need to report a H(e)NB local IP address and UDP port
    number information change;

  - the MME does not need to send UE's location and/or User CSG information
    or/and UE Time Zone and/or Presence Reporting Area information to the
    PDN GW;

  - the MME does not need to send an MME-FQ-CSID as per the requirements
    specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17];

  - ISR is not activated, if the Modify Access Bearers Request is sent as
    part of a UE triggered Service Request;

  - ISR was not activated in the old MME which is indicated by the ISRAU
    flag in the Context Response, if the Modify Access Bearers Request is
    sent as part of an Inter-MME E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without SGW
    change.

  - the support of ePCO has not be changed during inter MME mobility.

  - Secondary RAT Usage Data Report(s) is not required to be forwarded to
    the PGW(s) for any active PDN Connections.

The Modify Access Bearers Request message shall include all the bearer
contexts of all the PDN connections of the UE.

Support of this message is optional for the MME and SGW.

7.2.25 Modify Access Bearers Response

If an SGW supports the MABR feature (see subclause 8.83), the SGW shall
send a Modify Access Bearers Response message on the S11 interface to an
MME as a response to a Modify Access Bearers Request message.

If handling of all default bearers to be modified fails, then Cause at the
message level shall be a failure cause.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  -  "Request accepted".

  -  "Request accepted partially".

  -  "Context not found".

  -  "Service not supported".

  -  "Modifications not limited to S1-U bearers"

The SGW shall send the cause value "Modifications not limited to S1-U
bearers" if

  - it can not serve the MME Request without corresponding  S5/S8
    signalling other than to unpause charging in the PGW, or without
    corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8
    interface, or

  - if there are suspended non-GBR bearers for that UE in the SGW (NOTE 3).

Upon receipt of that cause value, the MME shall repeat its request using
Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection.

  NOTE 1:  This cause value is introduced for forward compatibility between
         an MME implementing this version of the specification and an SGW
         implementing a more recent version requiring the SGW to send S5/S8
         signalling.

  NOTE 2:  During an Inter-MME Intra-SGW handover/TAU, if the SGW, PGW and
         the old MME support the partial failure handling feature but the
         new MME doesn't, the SGW needs to inform the PGW about the change
         of FQ-CSID (see subclause 16.2.5 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]). If the
         SGW receives a Modify Access Bearers Request from the new MME, it
         can force the MME to send individual Modify Bearer Request message
         per PDN connection by returning the cause value "Modifications not
         limited to S1-U bearers".

  NOTE 3:  There may be some suspended non-GBR bearers in the SGW during an
         Inter-MME Intra-SGW Tracking Area Update without SGW Change when
         the UE is coming back to E-UTRAN via a different MME than the MME
         serving the UE before the CSFB or SRVCC call.

7.3  Mobility Management Messages


7.3.1  Forward Relocation Request

A Forward Relocation Request message shall be sent from:

  -  the source MME to the target MME over the S10 interface as part of an
    S1-based handover relocation procedure;

  -  the source MME to the target SGSN, or from the source SGSN to the
    target MME over the S3 interface as part of an Inter RAT handover and
    combined hard handover and SRNS relocation procedures;

  -  the source SGSN to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of
    an SRNS Relocation and PS handover procedures;-  the source MME to the
    target SGSN over the S3 interface as part of an SRVCC from E-UTRAN to
    UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support procedures and from the source SGSN
    to the target SGSN over the S16 interface as part of SRVCC from UTRAN
    (HSPA) to UTRAN or GERAN with DTM HO support;

  -  the source MME to the target AMF, or from the source AMF to the target
    MME over the N26 interface as part of the EPS to 5GS handover and 5GS
    to EPS handover procedures.

A source MME/SGSN which supports CIoT knows whether the target MME/SGSN
pool or target AMF (5GS) supports some CIoT optimisations either by using
DNS procedures enhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in
subclause 5.9 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. A source AMF knows whether the target
MME pool supports SGi Non-IP PDN connections either by using DNS procedures
enhanced for DCNs or by local configuration, as specified in subclause 5.9
of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32]. The target MME/SGSN may forward the Forward
Relocation Request to another MME/SGSN in the target MME/SGSN pool which is
more suitable to serve the UE, based on the information received in the
Forward Relocation Request message, e.g. required CIoT EPS optimisation(s)
applicable to the given UE's attachment.

  NOTE 1:  The source MME/SGSN/AMF does not need to know each individual
         CIoT feature the target MME/SGSN pool or target AMF (5GS) supports.
         The source MME/SGSN/AMF can behave as if the target MME/SGSN/AMF
         pool supports all CIoT features when the target MME/SGSN pool is
         known to support CIoT; the source MME/SGSN/AMF determines then
         which bearer contexts were successfully transferred as specified in
         sunclause 7.3.2.

  NOTE 2:  Among the CIoT optimization features, only the support of SCEF
         Non-IP PDN connection and the support of SGi Non-IP PDN connection
         are applicable to a SGSN.

  NOTE 3:  5GS supports Attach without PDU session. 5GS can also support
         Unstructured and Ethernet PDU session types, which are assimilated
         to "SGi Non-IP PDN connections" over N26.

Forward Relocation procedure across S10 interface (when KASME is taken into
use) shall be performed according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of
Security Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].

When the source MME/SGSN supports one or more of the CIoT optimization
features as specified in subclause 8.125, the source MME/SGSN shall
transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN connections or for PDN
connections to a SCEF only if the target serving node is known to support
SGi Non-IP PDN connections or SCEF Non-IP PDN connections respectively, as
specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.1 and 5.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3]. Likewise,
a source AMF shall transfer EPS bearer context(s) for SGi Non-IP PDN
connections only if the target MME is known to support SGi Non-IP PDN
connections. The source MME/SGSN/AMF shall not proceed with the Forward
Relocation Request procedure if the UE does not have any EPS bearer
context(s) for SGi IP or Non-IP PDN connections that can be transferred to
the target serving node, i.e. under the following conditions:

  -  If the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only the PDN
    connection(s) of PDN type "non-IP" through the SGW and the PGW, with or
    without SCEF PDN connections, and the target serving node is known to
    not support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection (as specified in subclause
    4.3.17.8.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and in subclause 5.3.13.8 of
    3GPP TS 23 060 [35]); or

  -  If the UE is attached to the source AMF (5GS) with only PDU session(s)
    of type "Ethernet" or "Unstructured", and the target MME is known to
    not support SGi Non-IP PDN Connection.

|NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (e.g. subclause 5.3.2.1) and 3GPP TS      |
|23.060 [35] (e.g. subclause 9.2.2.1) defines the MME/SGSN shall send |
|the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the PGW. In such  |
|case MME/SGSN shall use the Change Reporting Support Indication      |
|and/or CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (whichever is         |
|applicable), even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting      |
|Support Indication.                                                  |
|NOTE 2: GTPv2 shall be used for SRNS relocation w/o PDN connection if|
|all the S4-SGSNs (between which SRNS relocation can take place)      |
|support this optional GTPv2 procedure. Otherwise GTPv1 shall be used |
|for that procedure (see subclause 7.10). The S4-SGSN can know by     |
|local configuration whether all peer S4-SGSNs support this procedure.|
|                                                                     |
|NOTE 3: The receiver shall ignore the per UE Change Reporting Support|
|Indication and CSG Change Reporting Support Indication flags, as     |
|included within the Indication Flags IE above, if these flags are    |
|included per PDN connection i.e. within the Indication Flags IE of   |
|the MME/SGSN UE EPS PDN Connections IE.                              |
|NOTE 4: According to the 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], during an inter-RAT     |
|handover procedure for a UE with ISR activated, the source MME/SGSN  |
|should select the ISR associated CN node for this UE as the target CN|
|node for the inter RAT HO when the ISR associated CN node can serve  |
|the target access. This parameter is exchanged when ISR is being     |
|activated and used in the source MME/SGSN for this decision upon     |
|subsequent inter-RAT handover.                                       |
|NOTE 5: If the SGSN needs to include the last used LTE PLMN ID in the|
|Equivalent PLMN list it sends to the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [21]),   |
|the SGSN shall derive the last used LTE PLMN ID from the Serving     |
|Network IE.                                                          |
|NOTE 6: In shared networks, when the message is sent from the VPLMN  |
|to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in this IE shall be   |
|that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or    |
|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |
|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |
|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |
|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |
|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |
|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |
|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |
|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |
|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |
|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |
|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |
|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |
|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |
|NOTE 7: A UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used  |
|for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not |
|support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the   |
|sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage   |
|type was received in UE's subscription.                              |
|NOTE 8: There may be a pending MT Short Message at the SMS-GMSC      |
|during a handover scenario, when the UE performs a Service Request   |
|towards the source MME/SGSN and a handover procedure occurs shortly  |
|afterward, before the SMS-GMSC is alerted to retransmit the pending  |
|MT Short Message.                                                    |
|NOTE 9:  The target MME may compare the value of the Serving PLMN    |
|Rate Control received in the Forward Relocation Request message with |
|the one configured locally, to determine if this parameter needs to  |
|be updated towards the SCEF. The Serving PLMN Rate Control does not  |
|apply to any SGi PDN Connection in this message.                     |


The PDN Connection grouped IE shall be coded as depicted in Table 7.3.1-2.

|receives the PDN address "0.0.0.0" from PGW during "eUTRAN Initial   |
|Attach", "PDP Context Activation", "UE requested PDN Connectivity",  |
|then the MME/S4-SGSN shall include this IPv4 address "0.0.0.0".      |
|NOTE 2: 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (e.g. subclause 5.3.2.1) and 3GPP TS      |
|23.060 [35] (e.g. subclause 9.2.2.1) defines the MME/SGSN shall send |
|the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the PGW. In such  |
|case MME/SGSN shall use the Change Reporting Support Indication      |
|and/or CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (whichever is         |
|applicable), even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting      |
|Support Indication.                                                  |
|NOTE 3: When UE is camping on the 3G and performs a Service Request  |
|procedure, as specified in the subclause 6.12.1 of 3GPP TS 23.060    |
|[35], if Service Type indicates Signalling, the signalling connection|
|is established between the MS and the SGSN for sending upper-layer   |
|signalling messages, e.g. Activate PDP Context Request, but the      |
|resources for active PDP context(s) are not allocated, therefore the |
|change of Serving Network or UE Time zone may not be reported to     |
|SGW/PGW for the existing PDP Contexts.                               |
|NOTE 4: For PMIP based S5/S8, the 'PGW S5/S8 IP Address and TEID for |
|user plane' IE and the 'PGW S5/S8 IP Address for Control Plane or    |
|PMIP' IE shall contain the same uplink GRE key; the Interface Type in|
|these IEs shall be set to the value 9 (S5/S8 PGW PMIPv6 interface).  |
|NOTE 5: The target MME (respectively S4-SGSN) shall ignore this IE if|
|it is received from an S4-SGSN (respectively an MME), i.e. over the  |
|S3 interface. In this case, the target serving node shall consider   |
|that no ULI change reporting is requested by the PGW for the target  |
|RAT, and the PGW shall request the target serving node to start ULI  |
|change reporting for the target RAT if so desired.                   |
|NOTE 6: The PGW Node Name is used by the target AMF in the NF Service|
|Discovery procedure to find the combined PGW-C/SMF for the PDU       |
|Session during an MME to AMF mobility procedure.                     |

7.3.2  Forward Relocation Response

A Forward Relocation Response message shall be sent as a response to
Forward Relocation Request during S1-based handover procedure, Inter RAT
handover procedures, SRNS Relocation procedure and PS handover procedures,
EPS to 5GS handover and 5GS to EPS handover procedures.

Based on the List of Set-up Bearers IE in the Forward Relocation Response,
the source MME/AMF shall determine whether the bearer contexts for SGi (IP
or Non-IP) PDN connections were successfully transferred to the target
MME/AMF.

Based on the List of Set-up Bearers for SCEF PDN Connections IE in the
Forward Relocation Response, the source MME shall determine whether the
bearer contexts for SCEF PDN connections were successfully transferred to
the target MME, and initiate procedures to release the SCEF PDN connections
which were not successfully handed over.

Table 7.3.2-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

Cause IE indicates if the relocation has been accepted, or not. The
relocation has not been accepted by the target MME/SGSN/AMF if the Cause IE
value differs from "Request accepted". Possible Cause values are specified
in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause values are:

  -   "Relocation failure".

|NOTE 1: In the Forward Relocation Request message, the inclusion of  |
|"RAN Cause" indicates that the source access type is E-UTRAN. In the |
|Forward Relocation Request message, the inclusion of "RANAP Cause"   |
|indicates that the source access type is UTRAN. In the Forward       |

|NOTE 2: According to the 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], during an inter-RAT     |
|handover procedure for a UE with ISR activated, the source MME/SGSN  |
|should select the ISR associated CN node for this UE as the target CN|
|node for the inter RAT HO when the ISR associated CN node can serve  |
|the target access. This parameter is exchanged when ISR is being     |
|activated and used in the source MME/SGSN for this decision upon     |
|subsequent inter-RAT handover.                                       |

7.3.5  Context Request

The new MME/SGSN shall send the Context Request message to the old MME/SGSN
on S3/S16/S10 interface as a part of TAU/RAU procedure and UTRAN/GERAN to E-
UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC procedure to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts
for the UE.

  NOTE 1:  During UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC procedure as
         specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [43], the GUTI, RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and P-
         TMSI Signature IE, are not received directly from the UE but from
         the MSC Server over Sv interface.

The new MME shall send the Context Request message to the old AMF on N26
interface as a part of an 5GS to EPS Idle mode Mobility using N26 interface
procedure, to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts for the UE.

The new AMF shall send the Context Request message to the old MME on N26
interface as a part of an EPS to 5GS Idle mode registration using N26
interface procedure, to get the MM and EPS bearer Contexts for the UE.

If the sending/new node is a MME, it shall include in the Context Request
message:

  -  the GUTI IE and Complete TAU Request Message IE, if the GUTI or the
    indication of mapped or native GUTI received from UE indicates the old
    node is a MME, as specified in subclause 2.8.2.2.2 and 2.10.2.1.2 of
    3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

  -  the RAI IE and the P-TMSI IE, which are derived from the GUTI received
    from UE, and the P-TMSI Signature that was received intact from the UE,
    if the GUTI or the indication of mapped or native GUTI indicates the
    old node is an SGSN as specified in subclause 2.8.2.2.2 of
    3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

If the sending/new node is an SGSN, it shall include RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and
P-TMSI Signature IE in the Context Request message. If the receiving/old
node is an MME, it shall construct GUTI according to the RAI IE, P-TMSI IE
and P-TMSI Signature IE (see the mapping relationship between RAI, P-TMSI,
P-TMSI signature and GUTI defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), and find UE
context via this GUTI.

If the sending/new node is an AMF, it shall include the GUTI IE, which is
derived from the 5G-GUTI received from UE, and the Complete TAU Request
Message IE in the Context Request message, if the AMF receives a mapped
GUTI from the UE, that is indication that the old node is an MME, as
specified in subclause 2.10.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

If the receiving/old node is an AMF, it shall construct 5G-GUTI from the
GUTI IE (see the mapping relationship between GUTI and 5G-GUTI defined in
3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), and find UE context via this 5G-GUTI.

The new MME differentiates the type of the old node as specified in
subclause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. If the old node is an SGSN, the
GUTI shall be mapped to RAI and P-TMSI by the new MME; if the old node is a
MME, the new MME include GUTI IE and Complete TAU Request Message IE in the
Context Request message. The Mapping between temporary and area identities
is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

The Target PLMN ID IE shall be used in old SGSN/MME in order to decide
whether un-used authentication vectors to be distributed to new
SGSN/MME/AMF or not. Distribution and use of authentication vectors between
different serving network domains are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The
AMF shall not transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall
discard any un-used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless
of whether the MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network
domains.

7.3.6  Context Response

A Context Response message shall be sent as a response to a previous
Context Request message, in the scenarios identified in subclause 7.3.5.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  -  "IMSI/IMEI not known"

  -  "P-TMSI Signature mismatch"

  -  "User authentication failed"

  -  "Target access restricted for the subscriber"

Based on the subscription profile, when the access to the target RAT is
prohibited for the subscriber, the old MME/SGSN/AMF may reject the Context
Request message with the cause "Target access restricted for the
subscriber".

When the source MME/SGSN/AMF supports one or more of the CIoT optimization
features as indicated through the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE
specified in subclause 8.125, and if the target node is a MME and the
target MME has not set the AWOPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support
Indication IE set to 1 in the Context Request message as specified in
subclause 8.125, the source MME/SGSN/AMF shall reject the Context Request
with a cause value of "Request Rejected" under the following conditions
(conditions are mutually exclusive):

  -  If the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN without any PDN
    connection through the SGW and PGW and without any SCEF PDN connection;



  -  if the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only the PDN
    connection(s) of PDN type "non-IP", through the SGW and the PGW but the
    UE has not activated any SCEF PDN connection and the target MME/AMF has
    not set the SGNIPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE
    set to 1 in the Context Request message as specified in subclause
    8.125;

  -  if the UE is attached to the the source MME/SGSN with only the SCEF
    PDN connection(s) but the UE has not activated any PDN connection
    through the SGW and PGW and the target MME has not set the SCNIPDN bit
    of the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE set to 1 in the Context
    Request message as specified in subclause 8.125;

  -  if the UE is attached to the source MME/SGSN with only PDN
    connection(s) of PDN type "non-IP", through the SGW and the PGW and at
    least one SCEF PDN connection and the target MME has neither set the
    SGNIPDN bit nor the SCNIPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support
    Indication IE set to 1 in the Context Request message as specified in
    subclause 8.125;

  -  if the UE is registered to the source AMF without any PDU session;

  -  if the UE is registered to the source AMF with only PDU session(s) of
    type "Unstructured" or "Ethernet", and the target MME has not set the
    SGNIPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE set to 1 in
    the Context Request message as specified in subclause 8.125.

  NOTE 2:  Among the CIoT optimization features, only the support of SCEF
         Non-IP PDN connection and the support of SGi Non-IP PDN connection
         are applicable to a SGSN.

  NOTE 3:  5GS supports Attach without PDU session. 5GS can also support
         Unstructured and Ethernet PDU session types, which are assimilated
         to "SGi Non-IP PDN connections" over N26.

Table 7.3.6-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

|NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (e.g. subclause 5.3.2.1) and 3GPP TS      |
|23.060 [35] (e.g. subclause 9.2.2.1) defines the MME/SGSN shall send |
|the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the PGW. In such  |
|case MME/SGSN shall use the Change Reporting Support Indication      |
|and/or CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (whichever is         |
|applicable), even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting      |
|Support Indication.                                                  |
|NOTE 2: The receiver shall ignore the per UE Change Reporting Support|
|Indication and CSG Change Reporting Support Indication flags, as     |
|included within the Indication Flags IE above, if these flags are    |
|included per PDN connection i.e. within the Indication Flags IE of   |
|the MME/SGSN UE EPS PDN Connections IE.                              |
|NOTE 3: According to the 3GPP TS 23.401 [3], during an inter-RAT     |
|handover procedure for a UE with ISR activated, the source MME/SGSN  |
|should select the ISR associated CN node for this UE as the target CN|
|node for the inter RAT HO when the ISR associated CN node can serve  |
|the target access. This parameter is exchanged when ISR is being     |
|activated and used in the source MME/SGSN for this decision upon     |
|subsequent inter-RAT handover.                                       |
|NOTE 4: If the SGSN needs to include the last used LTE PLMN ID in the|
|Equivalent PLMN list it sends to the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [21]),   |
|the SGSN shall derive the last used LTE PLMN ID from the Old RAI IE  |
|received in the RAU request message.                                 |
|NOTE 5: In shared networks, when the message is sent from the VPLMN  |
|to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in this IE shall be   |
|that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or    |
|that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.  |
|As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement,  |
|if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or              |
|non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to  |
|the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID.        |
|In shared networks, when the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW pertain to the same |
|PLMN, the Primary PLMN ID shall be communicated in the ECGI to the   |
|PGW, and the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the  |
|PGW, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network    |
|Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated |
|by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in the  |
|TAI, RAI, UCI and the Serving Network.                               |
|See subclause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [55].                            |
|NOTE 6: A UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used  |
|for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not |
|support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the   |
|sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage   |
|type was received in UE's subscription.                              |
|NOTE 7: The old RAT shall be used by the target MME/SGSN to determine|
|if the RAT type has changed and, if so, to decide whether to maintain|
|or deactivate the PDN connections of the UE based on the             |
|PDN-Connection-Continuity subscription parameter and operator policy,|
|as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35]. A target |
|MME shall consider that the RAT type has changed if the target RAT is|
|NB-IoT and a source MME (complying with an earlier version of the    |
|specification) does not include the RAT Type IE in the Context       |
|Response.                                                            |
|NOTE 8:  The target MME may compare the value of the Serving PLMN    |
|Rate Control received in the Context Response message with the one   |
|configured locally, to determine if such parameter needs to be       |
|updated towards the SCEF and/or PGW.                                 |

|supports the 15 EPS Bearers, shall know whether the target MME pool  |
|also supports that by local configuration. When the target MME is    |
|known to not support the 15 EPS Bearers, the source MME shall only   |
|transfer up to 8 EPS bearer contexts with the EBI value set between  |
|'5' and '15' to the target MME and shall delete EPS bearer(s) which  |
|are not transferred, and if the default bearer is to be deleted, the |

7.3.7  Context Acknowledge

A Context Acknowledge message shall be sent as a response to a previous
Context Response message, only if the previous Context Response message is
received with the acceptance cause.

Possible cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  -  "User authentication failed".

  -  "Relocation failure due to NAS message redirection".

  -  "Denied in RAT".

Upon receiving cause value other than the request was accepted, the old
MME/S4-SGSN shall continue as if the Context Request was never received.

Table 7.3.7-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

7.3.8  Identification Request

If the UE identifies itself with temporary identity and it has changed
SGSN/MME since detach in Attach procedure, the new MME/SGSN shall send an
Identification Request message to the old SGSN/MME/AMF over S3, S16, S10 or
N26 interface to request IMSI.

  Editor's Note: An MME can initiate this procedure towards an AMF. It is
         FFS whether an AMF can initiate this procedure towards an MME.

Table 7.3.8-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

If the sending/new node is a MME, it shall include in the Identification
Request message:

  -  the GUTI IE and Complete Attach Request Message IE, if the GUTI or the
    indication of mapped or native GUTI received from UE indicates the old
    node is a MME, as specified in subclause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003
    [2].

  -  the RAI P-TMSI, which was derived from the GUTI received from UE, and
    the P-TMSI Signature that was received intact from the UE, if the GUTI
    or the indication of mapped or native GUTI indicates the old node is an
    SGSN as specified in subclause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

If the sending/new node is an SGSN, it shall include RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and
P-TMSI Signature IE in the Identification Request message. If the
receiving/old node is an MME, it shall construct GUTI according to the RAI
IE, P-TMSI IE and P-TMSI Signature IE (see the mapping relationship between
RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature and GUTI defined in 3GPP TS23.003[2]), and
find UE context via this GUTI.

The new MME differentiates the type of the old node as specified in
subclause 2.8.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. If the old node is an SGSN, the
GUTI shall be mapped to RAI and P-TMSI by the new MME; if the old node is a
MME, the new MME include GUTI IE and Complete Attach Request Message IE in
the Identification Request message. The Mapping between temporary and area
identities is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

The GUTI IE shall not coexist with any of the RAI IE, P-TMSI IE and P-TMSI
Signature IE in an Identification Request message. If this occurs, the
receiving node shall return a corresponding cause value in the response
message.

The Target PLMN ID IE shall be used in old SGSN/MME in order to decide
whether un-used authentication vectors to be distributed to new SGSN/MME or
not. Distribution and use of authentication vectors between different
serving network domains are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].

If the receiving/old node is an AMF, it shall construct the 5G-GUTI from
the GUTI IE (see the mapping relationship between GUTI and 5G-GUTI defined
in subclause 2.10 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), and find UE context via this 5G-
GUTI.

new MME/SGSN as a response to a previous Identification Request message
over S3/S10/S16/N26 interface.

Table 7.3.9-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

For Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes, if an old
SGSN within an SGSN pool receives an Identification Request message that
contains the optional parameter Address for Control Plane, the old SGSN
shall use this address as destination IP address of the Identification
Response message.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1. Message specific cause
values are:

  - "P-TMSI Signature mismatch"

  - "User authentication failed"

Only the Cause information element shall be included in the response if the
Cause contains another value than "Request accepted".

7.3.10 Forward Access Context Notification

A Forward Access Context Notification message shall be sent from the Old
SGSN to the New SGSN over the S16 interface to forward the RNC contexts to
the target system, or sent from the Old MME to the New MME over the S10
interface to forward the RNC/eNodeB contexts to the target system.

When the old SGSN receives the RANAP message Forward SRNS Context, the old
SGSN shall send a Forward Access Context Notification message to the new
SGSN. The new SGSN shall forward the message to the target RNC using the
corresponding RANAP message.

When the old SGSN receives a BSSGP message PS handover Required and the
acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the Bearer Context or
when "delivery order" is set in the Bearer Context QoS profile, the old
SGSN shall send a Forward Access Context Notification message with the PDU
Number IE to the new SGSN. The new SGSN shall forward the message to the
target RNC/ target BSS using the corresponding RANAP message only for PS
handover to Iu mode.

When the old SGSN receives a BSSGP message PS handover Required from source
BSS/RNC for PS handover to A/Gb mode, the value part of RAB Context IE
shall be empty according to its defined minimum length.

Table 7.3.10-1 specifics the presence requirements and conditions of the
IEs in the message.

7.3.12 Detach Notification

A Detach Notification message shall be sent from an MME to the associated
SGSN, or from an SGSN to the associated MME as a part of Detach procedure
if the ISR is activated between the MME and SGSN for the UE.

Possible Cause values are:

  - "Local Detach".

  - "Complete Detach".

A Detach Notification message shall also be sent from an SGSN to the
associated MME as a part of Detach procedure if the ISR is activated
between the MME and SGSN for the UE.

Possible Cause values are:

  - "IMSI Detach only".

"Local Detach" indicates that this detach is local to the MME/SGSN and so
the associated SGSN/MME registration where the ISR is activated shall not
be detached. The MME/SGSN that receives this message including this Cause
value of "Local Detach" only deactivates the ISR. This Cause value shall be
included in the procedures:

  - MME/SGSN-initiated Detach Procedure in case of implicit detach.

"Complete Detach" indicates both the MME registration and the SGSN
registration that the ISR is activated for, shall be detached. This
"Complete Detach" Cause value shall be included in the procedures:

  - UE-initiated Detach Procedure.

  - MME/SGSN-initiated Detach Procedure in case of explicit detach.

For the purpose of SGs handling, the SGSN shall include Detach Type in the
Detach Notification message for "Complete Detach" when the UE is combined
IMSI/EPS attached and the ISR is activated.

Possible Detach Type values are:

  - "PS Detach".

  - "Combined PS/CS Detach".

"PS Detach" indicates that the MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach from
EPS service as specified in section 5.4, 3GPP TS 29.118 [22]. "Combined
PS/CS detach" indicates that the MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach
from non-EPS service as specified in section 5.5, 3GPP TS 29.118 [22].

"IMSI Detach only" indicates that combined IMSI/EPS attached UE initiates
IMSI only GPRS detach from non-GPRS service as specified in section
4.7.4.1, 3GPP TS 24.008 [5], and both the SGSN/MME registration shall be
remained. The MME shall perform explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS service
for the SGs handling purpose, which is specified in section 5.5, 3GPP TS
29.118 [22]. This "IMSI Detach only" Cause value shall be included in the
procedures:

  - UE-initiated Detach Procedure for GERAN/UTRAN for "IMSI Detach only".

7.3.14   Change Notification Request

3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] specify that if PGW has requested
ECGI/eNodeB ID/TAI/CGI/SAI/RAI Change Reporting or reporting of change of
UE presence in Presence Reporting Area(s) or User CSG information Change
Reporting and if MME/S4-SGSN supports the feature, then MME/S4-SGSN shall
send the Change Notification Request message on the S11/S4 interface to the
SGW. If SGW supports the feature, the SGW forwards the message on the GTP
based S5/S8 interface to the PGW as part of location dependent charging
related procedures.

In this version of the specification, the sender shall set the header TEID
value to that of the peer node’s Control Plane TEID on S11/S4 interface or
to the peer node’s Control Plane TEID on S5/S8 interface. However a
receiver shall be prepared to receive messages in which the header TEID
value is set to zero from implementation conforming to earlier versions of
this specification. When that is the case, the receiver identifies the
subscriber context based on the included LBI, IMSI, and/or MEI IEs.

The MME shall increment the "MO Exception Data Counter" by one each time
the MME has received the RRC cause "MO Exception data". The MME may defer
sending a Change Notification Request message to report a non-zero value
for the "MO Exception Data Counter" based on local configuration.

If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting and if PDN GW
Secondary RAT reporting is active, the MME shall send the Change
Notification Request message and include "Secondary RAT Usage Data Report"
on the S11 interface to the SGW when it has received Secondary RAT usage
data from the eNodeB in the following procedures, regardless of whether ULI
shall be reported or not:

  - Connection Suspend

  - S1 release

  - E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT handover

  - E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT handover

  - MME triggered Serving GW relocation

  - MME to 3G SGSN combined hard handover and SRNS relocation

The MME may also send the send the Change Notification Request message and
include "Secondary RAT Usage Data Report" on the S11 interface to the SGW
when it has received periodic reporting of Secondary RAT usage data from
eNodeB, as described in TS 23.401 [3] subclause 5.7A. The SGW shall forward
the "Secondary RAT Usage Data Report" to the PGW if the IRPGW flag is set
to "1".

7.3.15 Change Notification Response

The Change Notification Response message may be sent on the S11/S4
interface by the SGW to the MME/SGSN and is sent on the S5/S8 interface by
the PGW to the SGW as part of location dependent charging related
procedures to acknowledge the receipt of a Change Notification Request.

If SGW does not support the feature (see subclause 7.3.14 "Change
Notification Request"), SGW may silently discard Change Notification
Request message from MME/SGSN. If the MME/ SGSN does not receive Change
Notification Response, the MME/SGSN may either send Change Notification
Request to the same SGW next time UE location changes, or not (marking SGW
as not supporting the feature).

The Cause value indicates whether or not the Change Notification Request
was received correctly. Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.
Message specific cause values are:

  - "Request accepted".

  - "Request accepted partially".

  - "IMSI/IMEI not known".

In this version of the specification, the sender shall set the header TEID
value to that of the peer node’s Control Plane TEID on S11/S4 interface or
to the peer node’s Control Plane TEID on S5/S8 interface. However a
receiver shall be prepared to receive messages in which the header TEID
value is set to zero from implementation conforming to earlier versions of
this specification. When that is the case, the receiver identifies the
subscriber context based on the included LBI, IMSI, and/or MEI IEs.

If the IMSI is unknown, or the IMEI is unknown when the UE is emergency
attached and UICCless or the UE is emergency attached but the IMSI is not
authenticated for the receiving GTP-C entity, then the message shall be
silently discarded and no further processing of the IEs shall continue.

If the MME/SGSN receives Change Notification Response containing a Cause
value of "IMSI/IMEI not known" and CS bit set to 1, this indicates that the
associated PDN connection does not exist within the PGW. The Change
Reporting mechanism shall be stopped in the receiving SGSN/MME for all
Bearers of the associated PDN connection. The SGSN/MME shall then initiate
PDN disconnection for all of these PDN Connections.

If the PDN Connection associated of the Change Notification Request message
received by the SGW does not exist within the SGW, the SGW shall return
Change Notification Response with the CS bit set to 0 to the MME/SGSN. The
Change Reporting mechanism shall be stopped in the receiving SGSN/MME for
all Bearers of the associated PDN connection, and the MME/SGSN shall then
locally delete the PDN connection and release all associated resources.

If the location Change Reporting mechanism is to be stopped or modified for
this subscriber in the SGSN/MME, then the PGW shall include the Change
Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action
field appropriately.

If the MME has sent the "MO Exception Data Counter" for the RRC Cause "MO
Exception data" in the Change Notification Resquest, the MME shall reset
the counter value when receiving the Change Notification Response message.

|Signature is not included in the message. The MME shall still reply  |
|the Suspend Acknowledge to the SGSN. Suspend procedure on MME, SGW   |
|and PGW are triggered by the S1 UE Context Release message sent from |
|the eNodeB to the MME. Refer to section 6.3 and section 7.4 in 3GPP  |
|TS 23.272 [21] for detail.                                           |
|NOTE 2: The IMSI is present only for backward compatibility reasons  |
|since the SGW can derive the context from the TEID in the header. In |
|scenarios where IMSI is not present (e.g. UICCless UE during an      |
|Emergency call) a dummy IMSI shall be provided.                      |

|Routeing Area Identity (RAI) IE.                                     |



7.4.2  Suspend Acknowledge

The Suspend Acknowledge message shall be sent on the S11 interface by the
SGW to the MME and on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to the SGW as part of
the 1xRTT CS fallback procedures in 3GPP TS 23.272 [21].

The Suspend Acknowledge message shall be sent on the S3 interface by the
MME to the SGSN, on the S11 interface by the SGW to the MME and on the
S5/S8 interface by the PGW to SGW as part of the SRVCC procedures in 3GPP
TS 23.216 [43] or the CS fallback from E-UTRAN access to UTRAN/GERAN CS
domain access related procedures in 3GPP TS 23.272 [21].

The Suspend Acknowledge message shall be sent on the S16 interface as per
the inter-SGSN suspend procedures in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].

The Suspend Acknowledge message shall be sent on the S16, the S4 and the
S5/S8 interfaces as part of the SRVCC from UTRAN (HSPA) to GERAN without
DTM support procedure in 3GPP TS 23.216 [43].

The Suspend Acknowledge message shall be sent on the S4 and the S5/S8
interfaces as part of the CS fallback from E-UTRAN to GERAN CS domain
related procedures in 3GPP TS 23.272 [21].

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.

For backward compatibility, if the IMSI IE is missing in the Suspend
Notification message that is received on the S11 interface, the cause value
"Mandatory IE missing" shall be used.

Table 7.4.2-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

7.4.3  Resume Notification

The Resume Notification message should be sent on the S11 interface by the
MME to the SGW and forwarded on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the PGW
as part of the resume procedure returning back to E-UTRAN in the case of CS
fallback or SRVCC.

The Resume Notification message should also be sent on the S4 interface by
the SGSN to the SGW and forwarded on the S5/S8 interface by the SGW to the
PGW as part of the resume procedure returning from SRVCC to HSPA if there
is no Modify Bearer Request message sent to the SGW and PGW as specified in
3GPP TS 23.216 [43].

The SGW may also send a Resume Notification message to the PGW on the S5/S8
interface upon receipt from the MME/S4-SGSN of a (non-empty) Modify Bearer
Request used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in the SGW and
in the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.3.2.1, 3GPP TS
23.272 [21] sections 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4) if the conditions of presence of the
IEs in the Modify Bearer Request specified in table 7.2.7-1 do not require
any IE to be sent over S5/S8 to the PGW.

  NOTE:  This is an alternative to sending over S5/S8 a Modify Bearer
         Request used as an implicit resume with zero IE(s), see subclause
         7.2.7.

After receiving a Resume Notification message or a Modify Bearer Request
used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers, the SGW/PGW clears
suspended status for all the non-GBR bearers. The PGW shall forward packets
it receives for the UE. If the suspended bearers are of the type S4-U GTP-
U, the SGW shall forward over the S4-U interface, packets it receives for
the UE, upon receipt of Resume Notification.

Table 7.4.3-1 specifies the presence requirements and conditions of the IEs
in the message.

7.4.4  Resume Acknowledge

The Resume Acknowledge message should be sent on the S11 interface by the
SGW to the MME and on the S5/S8 by the PGW to the SGW as part of the resume
procedure returning back to E-UTRAN in the case of CS fallback or SRVCC.

The Resume Acknowledge message should also be sent on the S4 interface by
the SGW to the SGSN and on the S5/S8 interface by the PGW to the SGW as
part of the resume procedure returning from SRVCC to HSPA if there is no
Modify Bearer Request message sent to the SGW and PGW as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.216 [43].

The PGW shall also send a Resume Acknowledge message to the SGW on the
S5/S8 interface as a response to a Resume Notification message sent by the
SGW upon receipt from the MME/S4-SGSN of a (non-empty) Modify Bearer
Request used as an implicit resume of the suspended bearers in the SGW and
in the PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [43] sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.3.2.1, 3GPP TS
23.272 [21] sections 6.3, 6.5 and 7.4) if the conditions of presence of the
IEs in the Modify Bearer Request specified in table 7.2.7-1 do not require
any IE to be sent to the PGW.

Possible Cause values are specified in Table 8.4-1.

7.6  Reliable Delivery of Signalling Messages

Retransmission requirements in the current subclause do not apply to the
Initial messages that do not have Triggered messages.

Reliable delivery in GTPv2 messages is accomplished by retransmission of
these messages. A message shall be retransmitted if and only if a reply is
expected for that message and the reply has not yet been received. There
may be limits placed on the total number of retransmissions to avoid
network overload.

Initial messages and their Triggered messages, as well as Triggered
messages and their Triggered Reply messages are matched based on the
Sequence Number and the IP address and port rules in subclause 4.2
"Protocol stack". Therefore, an Initial message and its Triggered message,
as well as a Triggered message and its Triggered Reply message shall have
exactly the same Sequence Number value. A retransmitted GTPv2 message (an
Initial or a Triggered) has the exact same GTPv2 message content, including
the GTP header, UDP ports, source and destination IP addresses as the
originally transmitted GTPv2 message.

For each triplet of local IP address, local UDP port and remote peer's IP
address a GTP entity maintains a sending queue with signalling messages to
be sent to that peer. The message at the front of the queue shall be sent
with a Sequence Number, and if the message has an expected reply, it shall
be held in a list until a reply is received or until the GTP entity has
ceased retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique
for each outstanding Initial message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint.
A node running GTP may have several outstanding messages waiting for
replies.  Not counting retransmissions, a single GTP message with an
expected reply shall be answered with a single GTP reply, regardless
whether it is per UE, per APN, or per bearer

A piggybacked initial message (such as a Create Bearer Request message or
Modify Bearer Request message) shall contain a Sequence Number that is
assigned by sending GTP entity and the message shall be held in a list
until a response is received. The response message to a piggybacked initial
message may arrive without piggybacking (e.g., Create Bearer Response at
PGW).

The Sequence Number in the GTP header of the triggered response message
shall be copied from the respective request message.

If a request message (e.g., Create Session Request) triggers piggybacking
(i.e., Create Bearer Request piggybacked on Create Session Response), re-
transmission of the request message shall also trigger piggybacking.  A
Sequence Number used for a Command message shall have the most significant
bit set to 1. A Sequence Number in a message, which was triggered by a
Command message, as well as respective Triggered Reply message shall have
the same Sequence Number as the Command message (i.e. shall also have the
most significant bit set to 1). This setting of the most significant bit of
the Sequence Number is done to avoid potential clashes between the Sequence
Number selected for a Command message, and the Sequence Number selected by
a GTPv2 peer for a Request message, which was not triggered by a Command
message.

A Sequence Number used for a Request message, which was not triggered by a
Command message shall have the most significant bit set to 0.

A timer, denoted T3-RESPONSE, shall be started when a signalling message
(for which a reply is expected) is sent. A signalling message or the
triggered message has probably been lost if a reply has not been received
before the T3-RESPONSE timer expires.

Once the T3-RESPONSE timer expires, the message corresponding to the T3-
RESPONSE timer is then retransmitted if the total number of retry attempts
is less than N3-REQUESTS times. The expiry of the timer for piggybacked
request messages shall result in re-transmission of the original IP/UDP
packet containing both the triggered response message and the piggybacked
initial message. T3-RESPONSE timer and N3-REQUESTS counter setting is
implementation dependent. That is, the timers and counters may be
configurable per procedure. Multileg communications (e.g. Create Session
Requests and Responses) however require longer timer values and possibly a
higher number of retransmission attempts compared to single leg
communication.

All received GTPv2 messages with an expected reply shall be replied to and
all reply messages associated with a certain message shall always include
the same information. Duplicated reply messages shall be discarded by the
receiver unless the reply needs a reply. A received reply message without a
matching outstanding message that is waiting for a reply should be
discarded.

If a GTPv2 node is not successful with the transfer of a non-Echo
signalling message, e.g. a Create Bearer Request message, it shall inform
the upper layer of the unsuccessful transfer so that the controlling upper
entity may take the necessary measures.

  NOTE:  At failure of sending a GTPv2 message after retransmissions, some
         information included in the message may be lost, e.g. Secondary RAT
         data usage report.


7.7  Error Handling


7.7.0  Handling Piggybacked Messages

For piggybacked initial messages, the following general rule shall apply:
the triggered response message carrying the piggybacked message shall be
processed first, according to the following sections. Subsequently, the
piggybacked initial message shall be processed independently. If the
processing of dedicated bearer activation message results in an error, this
shall not affect the default bearer establishment. If the default bearer
establishment fails, the dedicated bearer activation related message shall
be discarded.


7.7.1  Protocol Errors

A protocol error is defined as a message or an Information Element received
from a peer entity with unknown type, or if it is unexpected, or if it has
an erroneous content.

The term silently discarded is used in the following subclauses to mean
that the receiving GTP entity's implementation shall discard such a message
without further processing, or that the receiving GTP entity discards such
an IE and continues processing the message. The conditions for the
receiving GTP entity to silently discard an IE are specified in the
subsequent subclauses.

The handling of unknown, unexpected or erroneous GTP messages and IEs shall
provide for the forward compatibility of GTP. Therefore, the sending GTP
entity shall be able to safely include in a message a new conditional-
optional or an optional IE. Such an IE may also have a new type value. Any
legacy receiving GTP entity shall, however, silently discard such an IE and
continue processing the message.

If a protocol error is detected by the receiving GTP entity, it should log
the event including the erroneous message and may include the error in a
statistical counter.

For Request messages and Response messages without a rejection Cause value,
the following applies:

  -  An information element with "Mandatory" in the "Presence requirement"
    column of a message definition shall always be present in that message.

  -  An information element with "Conditional" in the "Presence
    requirement" column of a message definition shall be sent when the
    conditions detailed in the "Condition / Comment" column are met.

For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see subclause
6.1.1.

The Version Not Supported Indication message shall be considered as a
Triggered message as specified in subclause 4.2.5 "Messages with GTPv2
defined replies: Classification of Initial and Triggered Messages".

The receiving GTP entity shall apply the error handling specified in the
subsequent subclauses in decreasing priority.

If the received erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding GTP message,
the GTP transaction layer shall stop retransmissions and notify the GTP
application layer of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.


7.7.2  Different GTP Versions

If a GTPv2 entity receives a message of an unsupported GTP version, higher
than GTPv2, it shall return a Version Not Supported Indication message and
silently discard the received message.

If a GTPv2 entity listens to the GTPv0 port, the entity shall silently
discard any received GTPv0 message.

If a GTPv2 entity does not support GTPv1 and receives a GTPv1 message, it
shall silently discard the received message.


7.7.3  GTP Message of Invalid Length

If a GTP entity receives a message, which is too short to contain the
respective GTPv2 header, the GTP-PDU shall be silently discarded.

Apart from a piggybacked GTP message or an Echo Request message, if a GTP
entity receives a Request message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that
is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of the GTP
header, then the receiving GTP entity should log the error and shall send
the Response message with Cause IE value set to "Invalid Length".

Apart from a piggybacked GTP message, if a GTP entity receives a Response
message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is inconsistent with the
value specified in the Length field of the GTP header, then the receiving
GTP entity should log the error and shall silently discard the message.

If a GTP entity receives two GTP messages (triggered response message and a
piggybacked initial message) within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is
inconsistent with the total length of the two concatenated messages as
indicated by Length fields of the GTP headers, then the receiving GTP
entity should log the error and return an appropriate Response message with
Cause IE value set to "Invalid overall length of the triggered response
message and a piggybacked initial message". That is:

  -  for a Create Session Response message together with a piggybacked
    Create Bearer Request message, a Create Bearer Response message should
    be returned with the above Cause value.

  -  for a Create Bearer Response message together with a piggybacked
    Modify Bearer Request message, a Modify Bearer Response message should
    be returned with the above Cause value.


7.7.4  Unknown GTP Message

If a GTP entity receives a message with an unknown Message Type value, it
shall silently discard the message.


7.7.5  Unexpected GTP Message

If a GTP entity receives an unexpected initial message (see subclause 4.2
"Protocol stack"), for example a known message that is sent over an
interface for which the message is not defined, or a message that is sent
over an interface for which the message is defined, but the direction is
incorrect, then the GTP entity shall silently discard the message and shall
log an error.

If a GTP entity receives an unexpected triggered message which is not a
request message (see subclause 4.2 "Protocol stack"), for example a message
for which there is no corresponding outstanding request, it shall discard
the message and may log an error.

When a GTP entity receives an unexpected triggered message, which is a
request message, triggered by a command message, i.e. the MSB of the
sequence number is set "1", e.g. in Create/Update/Delete Bearer Request
messages, the GTP entity may continue to handle the request, e.g. to accept
the Delete Bearer Request message.

  NOTE:  Whether to accept or reject such a message is implementation
         specific.


7.7.6  Missing Information Elements

A GTP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Request message. Apart from Echo Request message, if one or more mandatory
information elements are missing in the received Request message, the GTP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to "Mandatory IE missing" together with the type and instance of
the missing mandatory IE.

If a GTP entity receives a Response message with Cause IE value set to
"Mandatory IE missing", it shall notify its upper layer.

A GTP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Response message without a rejection Cause value. If one or more mandatory
information elements are missing, the GTP entity shall notify the upper
layer and should log the error.

A GTP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Request message, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has
sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were
met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a GTP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to "Conditional IE missing" together with the type and instance
of the missing conditional IE.

A GTP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Response message without a rejection Cause value, if possible
(i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check
if the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional
information elements are missing, a GTP entity shall notify the upper layer
and should log the error.

For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see subclause
6.1.1.

If the Indication IE is applicable for the message as a conditional IE and
if it is not present, the GTP entity shall not reject the message unless
there are other reasons to reject the message.

If the Indication IE is applicable for the message as conditional IE and if
it is present with the value of all the applicable flags set to "0", the
GTP entity shall not reject the message unless there are other reasons to
reject the message.

Absence of an optional information element shall not trigger any of the
error handling processes.


7.7.7  Invalid Length Information Element

An information element has invalid length when the actual length of the IE
is different from the value of the Length field in the IE header. Here, the
actual length of the IE means the length of the content field of the
received IE.

If a GTP message contains more than one information elements and one or
more of them have invalid length, the receiving GTP entity can detect which
of the IEs have invalid length only in the following cases:

  -  If the Length value in the IE header is greater than the overall
    length of the message;

  -  If the invalid length IE is the last one in the message.

Apart from Echo Request message, if a receiving GTP entity detects
information element with invalid length in a Request message, it shall send
an appropriate error response with Cause IE value set to "Invalid length"
together with the type and instance of the offending IE.

Other Length field handling cases are specified below:

  -  If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
    fixed length IE are consistent, but the length is greater than that
    expected by the fixed number of octets, then the extra octets shall be
    discarded.

  -  If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
    fixed length IE are consistent, but the length is less than that
    expected by the fixed number of octets, this shall be considered an
    error, IE shall be discarded and if the IE was received as a Mandatory
    IE or a verifiable Conditional IE in a Request message, an appropriate
    error response with Cause IE value set to "Invalid length" together
    with the type and instance of the offending IE shall be returned to the
    sender.

  -  If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
    extendable length IE are consistent, but the length is greater than
    that expected by the fixed number of octets preceding the extended
    field(s), then the extra unknown octets shall be discarded.

  -  If the received value of the Length field and the actual length of the
    extendable length IE are consistent, but the length is less than the
    number of fixed octets defined for that IE, preceding the extended
    field(s), this shall be considered an error, IE shall be discarded and
    if the IE was received as a Mandatory IE or a verifiable Conditional IE
    in a Request message, an appropriate error response with Cause IE value
    set to "Invalid length" together with the type and instance of the
    offending IE shall be returned to the sender. Please refer to Table 8.1-
    1 for determining the number of fixed octets of an IE.


7.7.8  Semantically incorrect Information Element

Apart from Echo Request message, the receiver of a GTP signalling message
Request including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information
element with a semantically invalid Value shall discard the request, should
log the error, and shall send a response with Cause set to "Mandatory IE
incorrect" together with a type and instance of the offending IE.

The receiver of a GTP signalling message Response including a mandatory or
a verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid
Value shall notify the upper layer that a message with this sequence number
has been received and should log the error.

If a GTP entity receives an information element with a value which is shown
as reserved, it shall treat that information element as invalid and should
log the error. If the invalid IE is received in a Request, and it is a
mandatory IE or a verifiable conditional IE, the GTP entity shall send a
response with Cause set to "Mandatory IE incorrect " together with a type
and instance of the offending IE.

The principle is: the use of reserved values invokes error handling; the
use of spare values can be silently discarded and so in the case of IEs
with spare values used, processing shall be continued ignoring the spare
values.

The receiver of a GTP signalling message including an optional information
element with a Value that is not in the range defined for this information
element value shall discard this IE, but shall treat the rest of the
message as if this IE was absent and continue processing. The receiver
shall not check the content of an information element field that is defined
as 'spare".

All semantically incorrect optional information elements in a GTP
signalling message shall be treated as not present in the message.


7.7.9  Unknown or unexpected Information Element

The receiver of a GTP message including an unexpected information element
with known Type value, but with the instance value that is not defined for
this message shall discard the IE and log an error. The receiver shall
process the message.

An information element with a Type value which is defined in section 8.1 of
the present specification but whose Instance Value is not expected in the
received GTP signalling message according to the grammar defined in
section 7 of the present specification shall be silently discarded
(skipped) and the rest of the message processed as if this information
element was not present.

  NOTE:  An Information Element in an encoded GTPv2 message or grouped IE
         is identified by the pair of IE Type and Instance value.


7.7.10 Repeated Information Elements

An Information Element is repeated if there is more than one IE with the
same IE Type and Instance in the scope of the GTP message (scope of the
grouped IE). Such an IE is a member in a list.

If an information element is repeated in a GTP signalling message in which
repetition of the information element is not specified, only the contents
of the information element appearing first shall be handled and all
subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When
repetition of information elements is specified, only the contents of
specified repeated information elements shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.


7.7.11 TFT Error Handling

TFT related error handling for EUTRAN is specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23]
and for UTRAN/GERAN in 3GPP TS 24.008 [5].


7.8  Path Failure

Path failure handling procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].

7.9.0  General

Restoration and Recovery procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17].

7.10 Fallback to GTPv1 mechanism

An EPC entity shall assume that each GTP processing node that it is about
to communicate with is GTPv2 capable. Before the first GTP tunnel is setup
for a given UE/node, the EPC node shall always send a version 2 (GTPv2)
message to a peer node. As an exception, during an inter-SGSN handover,
even if the target SGSN is GTPv2 capable, the source SGSN shall send a
GTPv1 message "Forward Relocation Request" to the target SGSN if the PDP
Context(s) for this UE were established to GGSN(s), or if there is no
active PDP context and the source or target SGSN does not support SRNS
relocation w/o PDN connection over GTPv2 (see subclause 7.3.1).

A GTPv2 entity shall fallback to GTPv1 only if either a "Version Not
Supported" message in GTPv1 format as specified in 3GPP TS 29.060 [4] is
received from the peer node (this indicates that the peer GTP entity does
not support GTPv2), or if a GTPv2 message is received with Cause value
"Fallback to GTPv1".

If a GTPv1 "Version Not Supported" message in received, a GTPv2 entity may
fallback to GTPv1. 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] (see annex D) and 3GPP TS 23.060 [35]
specify GTP version usage during the mobility between a UTRAN/GERAN and an
E-UTRAN.

A GTPv2 entity may receive a GTPv2 message with a Cause value "Fallback to
GTPv1" in the following cases:

  -  an S4 SGSN receives the Cause code "Fallback to GTPv1" in a GTPv2
    Context Response message over S16 interface. When an UE has activated a
    PDP context via S4 SGSN to GGSN and inter-SGSN RAU is underway, the old
    S4 SGSN shall include the Cause value "Fallback to GTPv1" in a GTPv2
    Context Response message over S16 interface. In this case, the new S4
    SGSN shall abort the ongoing GTPv2 procedure and send a GTPv1 "SGSN
    Context Request" message to the old S4 SGSN. The fallback to GTPv1 is
    performed only for this UE in the current procedure.

  -  an MME receives the Cause code "Fallback to GTPv1" in a GTPv2 Context
    Response message over the S3 interface. When an UE has active PDP
    context(s) via an S4 SGSN and a TAU is underway, the old S4 SGSN may
    include the Cause value "Fallback to GTPv1" in a GTPv2 Context Response
    message over the S3 interface. In this case, the MME shall abort the
    ongoing GTPv2 procedure and should send a GTPv1 "SGSN Context Request"
    message to the old S4 SGSN. The fallback to GTPv1 is performed only for
    this UE.

Fallback to GTPv1 shall not occur on already established GTP tunnels
without change of the peer nodes of the communication bearer.


7.11 Fallback to GTPv0

Fallback from GTPv2 to GTPv0 shall not be supported. Therefore, GTPv2

8  GTP-C Information Elements


8.1  Information Element Types

A GTP control plane (signalling) message may contain several information
elements. In order to have forward compatible type definitions for the
GTPv2 information elements, all of them shall be TLIV (Type, Length,
Instance, Value) coded. GTPv2 information element type values are specified
in the Table 8.1-1. The last column of this table indicates whether the
information element is:

  -  Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of
    octets.

  -  Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable
    number of octets.
    For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to "5 to (n+4)".
    In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then the
    last field is not present.

  -  Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable
    number of octets.
    The last fields are typically specified with the statement: "These
    octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified". The legacy
    receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.

In order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended
that the information elements should be arranged in the signalling messages
as well as in the grouped IEs, according to the order the information
elements are listed in the message definition table or grouped IE
definition table in section 7. However the receiving entity shall be
prepared to handle the messages with information elements in any order.

Within information elements, certain fields may be described as spare.
These bits shall be transmitted with the value set to 0. To allow for
future features, the receiver shall not evaluate these bits. GTPv2-C
information elements that have similar semantics in GTPv1-C shall be
converted into GTPv1-C format, as specified in TS 29.060 [4], before
sending them to a pre-R8 GSN.

|IEs, for which the length is defined in terms of variable number of octets,|
|"4" is explicitly subtracted while defining the fixed number of octets.    |
|E.g. Length of User Location Information is defined as "f+4" and fixed     |
|number of octets for the same is defined as "f+4-4".                       |
|NOTE 2:  The IE Type value 254 indicates that the IE Type shall be further |
|identified by an IE Type Extension field; see subclause 8.2.1A. A GTP-C    |
|entity which does not support any IE Type encoded with an IE Type Extension|
|field shall ignore an IE received with the IE Type value 254.              |



8.2  Information Element Format


8.2.1  General

Figure 8.2-1 depicts the format of an information element.

| |        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |
| |2 to3   |Length = n                          |    |
| |4       |Spare            |Instance         |    |
| |5 to    |IE specific data or content of a    |    |
| |(n+4)   |grouped IE                          |    |


                  Figure 8.2-1: Information Element Format

  An IE has the following mandatory fields:

  -  Type field: This field indicates the type of Information Element. The
    valid values of the IE type are defined in clause 8.1.

  -  Length: This field contains the length of the information element
    excluding the first four octets, which are common for all information
    elements (Type, Length and the contents of octet 4) and is denoted "n"
    in Figure 8.2-1. For all the length fields, bit 8 of the lowest
    numbered octet is the most significant bit and bit 1 of the highest
    numbered octet is the least significant bit.

  -  Instance: This field shall be used to differentiate amongst different
    parameters in one specific message which use the same information
    element type (see also subclause 6.1.3 "Information Element Instance").

An IE is said to be TLIV (Type, Length, Instance, Value) encoded.


8.2.1A Information Element with an IE Type Extension field

Figure 8.2.1A-1 depicts the format of an information element with an IE
Type Extension field.

| |        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |
| |2 to 3  |Length = n                          |    |
| |4       |Spare            |Instance         |    |
| |5 to 6  |IE Type Extension                   |    |
| |7 to n+4|                                    |    |
| |        |IE specific data or content of a    |    |
| |        |group IE                            |    |


    Figure 8.2.1A-1: Information Element with an IE Type Extension field

The IE Type in octet 1 of an information element with an IE Type Extension
field shall be set to 254. Such IE shall be further identified by the value
encoded in the IE Type Extension field in octets 5 and 6.

The value of the IE Type Extension shall be encoded in full hexadecimal
representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) from 256 up to 65535. This
field indicates the type of the Information Element and the valid values of
the IE type Extension field are defined in subclause 8.1.

The semantics of the Length and Instance field remain the same as specified
in subclause 8.2.1.


8.2.2  Handling ASN.1/PER encoded parameters

During the TAU/RAU/HO procedures MME/S4-SGSN GTPv2 entities send some of
the RANAP/S1AP/BSSGP parameters to a GTPv2 peer. Copying of the BSSGP
parameters into GTPv2 IEs is straightforward. RANAP and S1AP, however, use
ASN.1/PER encoding, which is different from GTPv2 specific TLV encoding.

Transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters across GTPv2 interfaces:

  - a GTPv2 entity shall transparently copy the respective information into
    one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE as specified in Annex B and clause
    8.48. With this approach, GTPv2 will not be impacted if the contents of
    such RANAP/S1AP parameter changes over the time.

Non-transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP parameters across GTPv2 interfaces:

  -  GTPv2 entity decodes ASN.1/PER parameter and shall encode the value(s)
    into one or more octets of the GTPv2 IE according to what is specified
    in the present document.


8.3  International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)

International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is transferred via GTP
tunnels. The sending entity copies the value part of the IMSI into the
Value field of the IMSI IE. IMSI is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

| |        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |
| |2 to 3  |Length = n                          |    |
| |4       |Spare            |Instance         |    |
| |5       |Number digit 2   |Number digit 1   |    |
| |6       |Number digit 4   |Number digit 3   |    |
| |…       |…                |…                |    |
| |n+4     |Number digit m   |Number digit m-1 |    |


                             Figure 8.3-1: IMSI

Octets 5 to (n+4) represent the IMSI value in international number format
as described in ITU-T Rec E.212 [64], encoded as TBCD digits, i.e. digits
from 0 through 9 are encoded "0000" to "1001". When there is an odd number
of digits, bits 8 to 5 of the last octet are encoded with the filler
"1111". The maximum number of digits is 15.


8.4  Cause

Cause IE is coded as depicted in Figure 8.4-1.

|.|        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |
| |2 to 3  |Length = n                          |    |

| |a(n+2)  |Length of the offending IE = 0      |    |
| |to      |                                    |    |
| |a(n+3)  |                                    |    |
| |a(n+4)  |Spare                               |    |
| |        |Instance                            |    |
| |        |                                    |    |


                             Figure 8.4-1: Cause

Cause is a variable length IE, which may have either of the following two
lengths values:

  -  If n = 2, a = 0 and the Cause IE shall be 6 octets long. Therefore,
    octets "a(n+1) to a(n+4)" will not be present.

  -  If n = 6, a = 1 and the Cause IE will be 10 octets long.

For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW/MAG shall do the mapping between GTPv2 Cause
IE and respective PMIPv6 IE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.275 [26].

The following bits within Octet 6 indicate:

  -  Bits 8 to 4: Spare, for future use and set to zero

  -  Bit 1 – CS (Cause Source): If this bit is set to 1, it indicates that
    the corresponding error cause is originated by the remote node (i.e.,
    the MME/SGSN to a PGW, or the PGW to an MME/SGSN). This bit is set to 0
    to denote that the corresponding error cause is originated by the node
    sending the message.

    The CS should be set to 1 by the SGW when the SGW relay a response
    message with cause value from the MME/SGSN to the PGW or from the PGW
    to the MME/SGSN. For PMIP based S5/S8, the SGW shall set the CS bit to
    1 when the SGW/MAG relay a response message with the cause value from
    the PGW/LMA to the MME/SGSN.

  -  Bit 2 – BCE (Bearer Context IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it
    indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in
    the Bearer Context IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value
    is one of Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.

  -  Bit 3 – PCE (PDN Connection IE Error): If this bit is set to 1, it
    indicates that the corresponding rejection cause is due to the error in
    the PDN Connection IE. This bit shall be discarded if the cause value
    is one of Acceptance cause value as given in table 8.4-1.

The Cause value shall be included in a response message. In a response
message, the Cause value indicates the acceptance or the rejection of the
corresponding request message. The Cause value indicates the explicit
reason for the rejection.

If the rejection is due to a mandatory IE or a verifiable conditional IE is
faulty or missing, the offending IE shall be included within an additional
field "a(n+1) to a(n+4)". Only Type and Instance fields of the offending IE
that caused the rejection have a meaning. The length in the Octet 8-9 and
spare bits in the Octet 10 shall be set to "0". In this case, the value of
"n" shall be "6". Otherwise, the value of "n" is equal to "2".

The Cause may also be included in the request message. In a request
message, the Cause value indicates the reason for the request.

"Request accepted" is returned when the GTPv2 entity has accepted a control
plane request.

"Context Not Found" is used in the response message by a GTP entity when it
receives a message for which it does not have context, e.g. TEID-C or EBI
is not known. When "Context Not Found" is received at Bearer Context IE
level, it means the bearer context is unknown in the peer. When "Context
Not Found" is received at message level together with a known TEID-C in the
GTPv2-C header in the response message, this indicates some bearer contexts
are not known in the peer; the sender of the request message should further
determine, based on the bearer context(s) included in the request message,
that:

  -  if the default bearer is unknown, this means the PDN connection is not
    known in the peer;

  -  if one or more dedicated bearers are unknown, this means only those
    dedicated bearer contexts are not known in the peer.

"Context Not Found" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response
message during the non-3GPP to 3GPP access handover procedures, if the
request corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not
exist in the PGW.

"Context Not Found" may be used by the PGW in the Create Session Response
message during the 3GPP to non-3GPP access handover procedures, if the
request corresponds to the handover of a PDN connection which does not
exist in the PGW.

"Service not supported" is used by the GTP entity when it receives a
message, which corresponds to a feature or a service which is not supported
by the node.

"Service denied" is used when the requested service cannot be granted.

"System failure" is used by the GTP entity to indicate a generic error
condition.

"No resources available" is used by the GTP entity to indicate the
temporary unavailability of the resource(s) to process the received
request.

"Semantic error in the TFT operation", "Syntactic error in the TFT
operation", "Semantic errors in packet filter(s)", "Syntactic errors in
packet filters(s)", "UE context without TFT already activated", "Semantic
error in the TAD operation" and "Syntactic error in the TAD operation" are
indications of error cases involving TFT(s)/TAD(s) as specified in
subclause 7.7.11 in this specification.

"Missing or unknown APN" is used by the PGW when it does not support the
Access Point Name, received in Create Session Request message.

"Relocation failure" is used by the target MME/S4-SGSN to indicate the
source MME/S4-SGSN that the relocation has failed.

"Relocation failure due to NAS message redirection" is used by the new
MME/S4-SGSN to indicate to the old MME/S4-SGSN that the TAU/RAU procedure
is not successful due to NAS message redirection as described in 3GPP TS
23.401 [3].

"Denied in RAT" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the requested
service is not accepted in the RAT.

"Preferred PDN type not supported" is used by the PGW to indicate that the
PDN type received in the Create Session Request message is not supported by
the PGW for the PDN corresponding to the received Access Point Name.

"Protocol type not supported" is used by the SGW to indicate that the S5/S8
protocol type requested by the MME/S4-SGSN is not supported by it.

"UE not responding" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate that the UE is
not responding to the request initiated by the network, e.g. Paging.

"UE refuses" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the UE, without
specifying further detail, rejected the request from the network.

"Unable to page UE" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to indicate its inability to
page the UE, temporarily.

"User authentication failed" is used by the GTP entity to indicate that the
request is rejected due to failure in authentication/security procedure.

"APN access denied – no subscription" is used to indicate that the PGW has
denied the user access to an APN because a subscription is required, but
the subscriber does not have the necessary subscription.

"Remote peer not responding" is used by the SGW for the messages spanning
through two interfaces.  This cause value is returned by the SGW to the
MME/S4-SGSN or PGW in a response message where no response message is
received from the PGW or MME/S4-SGSN.

"Collision with network initiated request" is used by the PGW to indicate
that the UE-initiated bearer resource allocation/modification request is
rejected since the PGW has requested a bearer resource
allocation/modification for the same service using a network-initiated
procedure.

"Unable to page UE due to Suspension" is used by the MME/S4-SGSN to
indicate that the UE has not been paged because the bearers of the UE are
in a suspended state.

"APN Restriction type Incompatible with currently active PDN connection" is
used by the PGW to indicate that the newly requested PDN connection has APN
restriction value that is not compatible with the currently active PDN
connection(s)'s APN restriction value(s).

"Invalid peer" is used by the SGW to indicate that currently the UE is
being managed by the different node (e.g. MME/S4-SGSN) than the node (e.g.
S4-SGSN/MME) which has sent the Delete Session Request message.

"Invalid Reply from remote peer" is used by the SGW for the messages
spanning through two interfaces. This cause value is returned by the SGW to
the MME/SGSN or PGW in a reply message where the corresponding reply
message on S5/S8 or S11/S4 from the PGW or MME/SGSN is not decoded as
valid.

"Temporarily rejected due to handover/TAU/RAU procedure in progress" is
used by the MME/S4-SGSN for the bearer related procedure initiated by the
PGW. When the handover/TAU/RAU with/without SGW change and/or MME/S4-SGSN
change is in progress, the MME/S4-SGSN may receive Create / Update / Delete
Bearer request message for the bearer creation, modification or deletion
initiated by the PGW. If the handover/TAU/RAU procedure results in the SGW
and/or MME/S4-SGSN change, then the bearer related procedure cannot be
handled temporarily by the MME/S4-SGSN till the handover/TAU/RAU procedure
is completed. In that case the MME/S4-SGSN shall reject the bearer related
procedure with this rejection cause. This cause is also used to indicate
that the Downlink Data Notification message is rejected temporarily due to
the mobility procedures with MME or SGSN change in progress as specified in
sub-clause 5.3.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3].

The usage of "Fallback to GTPv1" is specified in subclause 7.10 "Fallback
to GTPv1 mechanism".

In the PGW initiated bearer deactivation procedure for the default bearer,
the PGW may include the Cause IE in the Delete Bearer Request with values
"RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP", "Reactivation requested" or
"Reactivation disallowed to APN".

"APN Congestion" is used by the PGW and it indicates that the PGW has
detected congestion for the requested APN and performs overload control for
that APN which does not allow the PDN connection to be established.

"GTP-C Entity Congestion" is used to indicate that the GTP-C entity has
detected node level congestion and performs overload control at the node
level, which does not allow the request to be processed.

"UE already re-attached" is used by MME/S4-SGSN for the network triggered
service restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.007 [17]. The
MME/S4-SGSN may send the Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge or Downlink
Data Notification Failure Indication with this cause as part of the network
triggered service restoration procedure.

"PDP connection inactivity timer expires" is used by the PGW in Delete
Bearer Request(s) to indicate that all the bearer(s) for the emergency PDN
connection are deleted upon the inactivity timer expiry as specified in
3GPP TS 23.203 [48].

"Network failure" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session Request
to indicate that the message is sent due to a network problem.

"QoS parameter mismatch" is used by the SGSN or MME in the Delete Session
Request to indicate that the PDN connection can not be established due to a
QoS parameter mismatch.

"MME/SGSN refuses due to VPLMN policy" is used by the MME/SGSN in the VPLMN
to indicate to the PGW in the Create Bearer Response or Update Bearer
Response that it does not allow the establishment or modification of the
bearer due to VPLMN operator's policy.

The listed cause values for rejection response message descriptions in
clause 7 are not meant to be exhaustive lists. Therefore a GTPv2 node shall
use the most appropriate matching rejection response cause value that is
listed in Table 8.4-1.

If a Bearer Resource Command message is related to an established PDN
connection for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject
the Bearer Resource Command with the cause value of "Bearer handling not
supported".

"Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed" is used by SGW for
reply message to the MME/S4-SGSN when PMIP-based S5/S8 is used. If either
SGW or PGW does not support the multiple PDN connections to the same APN
function, the SGW shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure with
this rejection cause when receiving Create Session Request for additional
PDN connectivity to the given APN from the same UE.

As specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause
9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value "New PDN type due to network
preference" indicates that the UE has requested PDN type IPv4v6 and only
IPv4 or IPv6 address is allowed for the PDN based on PGW operator policy.

As specified in sub-clause 5.3.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and sub-clause
9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], the cause value "New PDN type due to single
address bearer only" indicates that the MS has requested PDN type IPv4v6
and both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual
Address Bearer Flag of the Indication IE is set to 0 or the Indication IE
is absent, or only single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN.

"PGW not responding" is used by the SGW in PGW Restart Notification to
indicate that the peer PGW has failed and not restarted as specified in
subclause 7.9.5.

"UE context without TFT already activated" is used by the PGW in the Bearer
Resource Failure Indication message to indicate that the PGW has received
the Bearer Resource Command message without TAD IE in the secondary PDP
Context Activation procedure.

"Target access restricted for the subscriber" is used by the MME/SGSN in
the Context Response message to indicate that the target access is
prohibited for the subscriber, based on the subscription profile.

"P-TMSI Signature mismatch" is used by the SGSN or MME in the
Identification Response and Context Response message if the P-TMSI
Signature stored in the old SGSN or MME does not match the value sent by
the UE via the new SGSN or MME.

"Late Overlapping Request" is used by the PGW in the Create Session
Response to indicate that the incoming request collides with an existing
session which has a more recent time stamp than the time stamp of the new
request, as specified in subclause 13.2.

"Timed Out Request" is used by the SGW and PGW in the Create Session
Response to indicate that the incoming request is known to have already
timed out at the originating entity, as specified in subclause 13.3.

"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving" is used by the
MME/SGSN in the Create/Update Bearer Response message to reject the
corresponding network initiated procedures for a Delay Tolerant PDN
connection and also request the PGW to hold the network initiated procedure
until it receives the subsequent Modify Bearer Request message with the
UASI flag indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.

"UE not authorised by OCS or external AAA Server" is used by the PGW in the
Create Session Response to reject the corresponding UE initiated procedures
when the OCS or an external AAA Server on SGi did not authorise it and the
support of the Cause Code was indicated by the SGSN/MME within the Create
Session Request.

If a Create Session Request message requests the addition of an access to a
PDN connection, and NBIFOM is not supported by the MME/SGSN, SGW or TWAN,
the PGW should reject the request with the cause value of "Multiple
accesses to a PDN connection not allowed". This cause is also used by the
PGW in the Delete Bearer Request message to initiate the removal of 3GPP
access from the PDN connection due to detection of the MME/SGSN or SGW not
supporting NBIFOM at the inter-PLMN mobility procedure.

"Request rejected due to UE capability" is used by the MME in the Create
Bearer Response to reject the request to add an EPS bearer that would
exceed the UE capability (e.g. a NB-IoT UE can only support up to 2 EPS
bearers). This cause value does not prevent the PGW from sending Create
Bearer Request later.

8.6  Access Point Name (APN)

Access Point Name (APN) is transferred via GTP tunnels. The sending entity
copies the value part of the APN into the Value field of the APN IE.

| |        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |

                    Figure 8.6-1: Access Point Name (APN)

The encoding the APN field follows 3GPP TS 23.003 [2] subclause 9.1. The
content of the APN field shall be the full APN with both the APN Network
Identifier and APN Operator Identifier being present as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [2] subclauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2, 3GPP TS 23.060 [35] Annex A and
3GPP TS 23.401 [3] subclauses 4.3.8.1.

  NOTE:  The APN field is not encoded as a dotted string as commonly used
         in documentation.


8.7  Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR)

Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR) is transferred via GTP tunnels. The
sending entity copies the value part of the AMBR into the Value field of
the AMBR (APN-AMBR) IE.

AMBR is defined in subclause 9.9.4.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23], but it shall
be encoded as shown in Figure 8.7-1 as Unsigned32 binary integer values in
kbps (1000 bits per second).

| |        |Bits                                |    |
| |Octets  |8                                   |7   |
| |2 to 3  |Length = 8                          |    |
| |4       |Spare            |Instance         |    |
| |5 to 8  |APN-AMBR for uplink                 |    |
| |9 to 12 |APN-AMBR for downlink               |    |


               Figure 8.7-1: Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (AMBR)

The APN-AMBR for uplink and the APN-AMBR for downlink may require
converting values in bits per second to kilo bits per second when the APN-
AMBR for uplink and the APN-AMBR for downlink are received from an
interface other than GTPv2 interface. If such conversions result in
fractions, then the value of APN-AMBR for uplink and the APN-AMBR for
downlink shall be rounded upwards.

  NOTE:  The encoding in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] is different from the encoding
         within this specification.


8.8  EPS Bearer ID (EBI)

EPS Bearer ID (EBI) is coded as depicted in Figure 8.8-1.

The overall length of the IE is 5 octets. In future releases of the spec

The ME Identity field contains either the IMEI or the IMEISV as defined in
subclause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. It is encoded as specified in
subclause 7.7.53 of 3GPP TS 29.060 [4], beginning with octet 4 of Figure
7.7.53.1.

The IMEI(SV) digits are encoded using BCD coding where IMEI is 15 BCD
digits and IMEISV is 16 BCD digits. For IMEI, bits 5 to 8 of the last octet
shall be filled with an end mark coded as '1111'.

Octets 5 to (n+4) represent the MSISDN value is in international number
format as described in ITU-T Rec E.164 [25] and 3GPP TS 29.002 [41]. MSISDN
value contains only the actual MSISDN number (does not contain the "nature
of address indicator" octet, which indicates "international number" as in
3GPP TS 29.002 [41]) and is encoded as TBCD digits, i.e. digits from 0
through 9 are encoded "0000" to "1001". When there is an odd number of
digits, bits 8 to 5 of the last octet are encoded with the filler "1111".


8.12 Indication

    last reported by the MME/S4-SGSN. The SGW shall ignore this flag when
    ISR is not active.

  -  Bit 7 – ARRL (Abnormal Release of Radio Link): if this bit is set to 1
    by the MME, it indicates to the SGW that the access bearers are
    released due to an abnormal release of the radio link.  Based on

    the SGW during a network initiated procedure and holding the network
    initiated procedure, until the PGW receives the subsequent Modify
    Bearer Request message with the UASI flag indicating that the UE is
    available for end to end signalling.

  Bit 5 – BDWI (Buffered DL Data Waiting Indication): if this bit is set to

    Information" which shall be associated with the node identity (i.e.
    FQDN or the IP address received from the HSS or DNS during the PGW
    selection) of the serving PGW.

The following bits within Octet 10 shall indicate:

  -  Bit 8 – ROAAI (Release Over Any Access Indication): If this bit is set
    to 1, it indicates to the PGW that, if this is an NB-IFOM PDN
    connection, the PGW shall initiate the release of the corresponding PDN
    connection over the non-3GPP access over the S2a/S2b interface with the
    cause "Local release".

  -  Bit 7 – EPCOSI (Extended PCO Support Indication): If this bit is set
    to 1, it indicates to the receiver that the Extended PCO is supported,
    e.g. when the PGW is the receiver, it indicates that the UE, the MME
    and the SGW support Extended PCO; when the target MME is the receiver,
    during an inter-MME mobility, it indicates that UE and the source MME
    support Extended PCO.

  -  Bit 6 – CPOPCI (Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indication): If this
    bit is set to 1, it indicates that the PDN Connection is set to Control
    Plane Only, i.e. the user data pertaining to this PDN connection can
    only be transferred in NAS PDUs via the control plane.

  -  Bit 5 – PMTSMI (Pending MT Short Message Indication): If this bit is
    set to 1, it indicates to the target MME/S4-SGSN that there is one (or
    more) pending MT Short Message(s) in the SMS-GMSC, i.e. that the target
    MME/S4-SGSN shall provide its E.164 address and Diameter Identity if
    available to receive the MT Short message and maintain the signalling
    connection with the UE for a longer time to enable the retransmission
    of the Short Message.

  -  Bit 4 – S11-U Tunnel Flag (S11TF): This flag shall be set to 1 on the
    S11 interface if user data is transported in NAS signalling.

  -  Bit 3 – PNSI (Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling
    Indication): if this bit is set to 1, it indicates to the target
    MME/SGSN that there is pending network initiated PDN connection
    signalling for the PDN connection, i.e. the target MME/SGSN shall set
    UASI flag in the Create Session Request or Modify Bearer Request
    message to indicate to the PGW that the UE is available for end to end
    signalling.

  -  Bit 2 – UNACCSI (UE Not Authorised Cause Code Support Indication): If
    this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the Cause Code for "UE not
    authorized by OCS or external AAA Server" is supported by the S4-
    SGSN/MME.

  -  Bit 1 - WLCP PDN Connection Modification Support Indication (WPMSI):
    if this bit is set to 1, it indicates that the TWAN supports the WLCP
    PDN Connection Modification procedure. This indication is used by the P-
    CSCF restoration extension procedure for TWAN access (see 3GPP TS
    23.380 [61]).

The following bits within Octet 11 shall indicate:

  -  Bit 6 to 8 – Spare, for future use and set to zero.

  -  Bit 5 –EEVRSI (Extended EBI Value Range Support Indication): if this
    bit is set to 1, it indicates that the sending GTPv2 entity supports

    bit is set to 1, it indicates to the SGW to forward the LTE-M RAT type
    to the PGW;

  -  Bit 2 – ENBCRSI (eNB Change Reporting Support Indication): if this bit
    is set to 1, it indicates that the MME supports Macro eNodeB Change
    Reporting mechanism for the corresponding session.

  -  Bit 1 –TSPCMI (Triggering SGSN initiated PDP Context
    Creation/Modification Indication): if this bit is set to 1, it
    indicates to the S4-SGSN that in the UE_initiated PDP Context
    Modification procedure, when the NBIFOM container is included, the S4-
    SGSN accepts the UE initiated PDP Context Modification procedure and
    initiates SGSN initiated PDP Context Creation/modification procedures
    respectively towards UE to transfer the NBIFOM container received from
    the PGW either in Create Bearer Request or Update Bearer Request
    message as specified in 3GPP TS 23.161 [71].


8.13 Protocol Configuration Options (PCO)

Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) is transferred via GTP tunnels. The
sending entity copies the value part of the PCO into the Value field of the

Octet 5 represents the Allocation/Retention Priority (ARP) parameter. The
meaning and value range of the parameters within the ARP are defined in
3GPP TS 29.212 [29]. The bits within the ARP octet are:

  -  Bit 1 – PVI (Pre-emption Vulnerability): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29],
    clause 5.3.47 Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP.

  -  Bit 2 – spare

  -  Bits 3 to 6 – PL (Priority Level): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29], clause
    5.3.45 Priority-Level AVP. PL encodes each priority level defined for
    the Priority-Level AVP as the binary value of the priority level.

  -  Bit 7 – PCI (Pre-emption Capability): See 3GPP TS 29.212[29], clause
    5.3.46 Pre-emption-Capability AVP.

  -  Bit 8 – spare.

Octet 6 contains the "QCI" value, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [48].

The UL/DL MBR and GBR fields are encoded as kilobits per second (1 kbps =
1000 bps) in binary value. The UL/DL MBR and GBR fields may require
converting values in bits per second to kilobits per second when the UL/DL
MBR and GBR values are received from an interface other than GTPv2
interface. If such conversions result in fractions, then the value of UL/DL
MBR and GBR fields shall be rounded upwards. For non-GBR bearers, both the
UL/DL MBR and GBR should be set to zero. The range of QCI, Maximum bit rate
for uplink, Maximum bit rate for downlink, Guaranteed bit rate for uplink
and Guaranteed bit rate for downlink are specified in 3GPP TS 36.413 [10].

  NOTE:  The encoding in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] is
         different from the encoding within this specification.


8.16 Flow Quality of Service (Flow QoS)

Flow Quality of Service (Flow QoS) is transferred via GTP tunnels. The
sending entity copies the value part of the Flow QoS into the Value field
of the Flow QoS IE.

Octet 5 contains the "QCI" value, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [48].

The UL/DL MBR and GBR fields are encoded as kilobits per second (1 kbps =
1000 bps) in binary value. For non-GBR bearers, both the UL/DL MBR and GBR
should be set to zero. The range of QCI, Maximum bit rate for uplink,
Maximum bit rate for downlink, Guaranteed bit rate for uplink and
Guaranteed bit rate for downlink are specified in 3GPP TS 36.413 [10].

  NOTE 1:  For S4-SGSN, currently it is only possible to detect the
         difference between GERAN and UTRAN when GERAN Gb mode is used. If
         GERAN Iu mode is used, then an S4-SGSN may not be able to detect
         the difference between GERAN and UTRAN. Across the Gb interface,
         the SGSN may also not be able to detect the difference between
         GERAN and GAN. If S4-SGSN cannot detect that the HSPA Evolution
         3GPP TR 25.999 [46] network is behind the Iu interface, the S4-SGSN
         will send the "UTRAN" RAT Type.

  NOTE 2:  For the Iu interface case, if the SGSN detects UTRAN or HSPA, it
         sets the RAT-Type to "UTRAN". If the SGSN detects HSPA+, it sets
         the RAT-Type to "HSPA Evolution", otherwise the SGSN will send the
         "UTRAN" RAT Type.

  NOTE 3:  The MME sets the LTE-M RAT-Type for a UE accessing E-UTRAN and
         indicating Category M in its UE radio capability, as specified in
         3GPP TS 23.401 [3].

                       Figure 8.18-1: Serving Network

If an Administration decides to include only two digits in the MNC, then
bits 5 to 8 of octet 6 are coded as "1111".

Unless specified otherwise in the specification, this IE contains the
serving core network operator ID provided by the MME, S4-SGSN or ePDG, or
the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN used for 3GPP-based access
authentication provided by the TWAN.

  NOTE:  The serving core network operator ID is the PLMN ID of the MME, S4-
         SGSN or ePDG which is currently serving the UE. An S4-SGSN/MME
         which supports multiple PLMN IDs is considered as logically
         different S4-SGSNs/MMEs.


8.19 EPS Bearer Level Traffic Flow Template (Bearer TFT)

The ULI IE shall contain only one identity of the same type (e.g. more than
one CGI cannot be included), but ULI IE may contain more than one identity
of a different type (e.g. ECGI and TAI). The flags LAI, ECGI, TAI, RAI, SAI
, CGI, Macro eNodeB ID, and Extended Macro eNodeB ID in octet 5 indicate if
the corresponding type shall be present in a respective field or not. If
one of these flags is set to "0", the corresponding field shall not be
present at all. If more than one identity of different type is present,
then they shall be sorted in the following order: CGI, SAI, RAI, TAI, ECGI,
LAI, Macro eNodeB ID, Extended Macro eNodeB ID. Only one of the Macro
eNodeB ID or Extended Macro eNodeB ID shall be present in the ULI IE.

The following subclauses specify the coding of the fields representing
different identities.

For each identity, if an Administration decides to include only two digits
in the MNC, then "MNC digit 3" field of corresponding location shall be
coded as "1111".

  -  Bit 7 – V6: If this bit is set to "1", then IPv6 address field exists
    in the F-TEID, otherwise the IPv6 address field is not present at all.

At least one of V4 and V6 shall be set to "1", and both may be set to "1".

Other values of "Interface Type" are spare and reserved for future use.

"Interface type" values with bit "6" set to 1 shall only be used between
Rel-10 onwards GTPv2-C nodes.

  NOTE 1:  "Interface type" IE is defined with 5 bits only in the earlier
         releases of this specification, thus pre-Rel-10 GTPv2-C nodes can
         ignore bit "6" which is marked as "Spare" in earlier releases,
         allowing backward compatibility.

  NOTE 2:  Interface Type 8 is not used in this Release and in earlier
         Releases.

Octet 6 to 9 (TEID/GRE field) represent either a TEID or a GRE key. If both
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are present in F-TEID IE, then the TEID value shall
be shared by both addresses.

Octets "m to (m+3)" and/or "p to (p+15)" (IPv4 address / IPv6 address
fields), if present, contain respective address values.

8.28 Bearer Context

Bearer Context is a grouped IE containing a number of other IEs. Which of
those IEs are mandatory, optional or conditional and the conditions that
apply are GTP message specific, and described in the corresponding
subclause under clause 7.

Bearer Context may be repeated within a message with exactly the same Type
and Instance values to represent a list of Bearer Contexts.

Bearer Context is coded as depicted in Table 8.28-1.

The following bits within Octet 5 indicate:

  -  Bit 1 – PPC (Prohibit Payload Compression): This flag is used to
    determine whether an SGSN should attempt to compress the payload of
    user data when the users asks for it to be compressed (PPC = 0), or not
    (PPC = 1).

  -  Bit 2 – VB (Voice Bearer): This flag is used to indicate a voice
    bearer when doing PS-to-CS (v)SRVCC handover.

  -  Bit 3 – Vind (vSRVCC indicator): This flag is used to indicate that
    this bearer is an IMS video bearer and is candidate for PS-to-CS vSRVCC
    handover.

  -  Bit 4 - ASI (Activity Status Indicator): When set to 1, this flag
    indicates that the bearer context is preserved in the CN without
    corresponding Radio Access Bearer established. The target S4-SGSN shall
    keep the bearer context associated with this indicator preserved. When
    the target S4-SGSN sends Relocation Request message towards the target
    RNC, the target S4-SGSN may not request to setup the RABs for those
    bearer contexts associated with this indicator.

8.38 MM Context

The MM Context information element contains the Mobility Management, UE
security parameters that are necessary to transfer over S3/S16/S10/N26
interface.

All Spare bits are set to zeros by the sender and ignored by the receiver.
Spare bits in MM Context IE shall be set to 1's before sending MM Context
IE to Gn/Gp SGSN.

  NOTE 1:  The encoding of Spare bits in MM Context IE is different between
         GTPv1 and GTPv2. Spare bits in GTPv1 in MM Context IE there are set
         to 1s.

Security Mode indicates the type of security keys (GSM/UMTS/EPS) and
Authentication Vectors (quadruplets /quintuplets/triplets) that are passed
to the new MME/SGSN/AMF.

The DRX parameter coding is specified in clause 10.5.5.6 of 3GPP TS 24.008
[5]. If DRXI (DRX Indicator), bit 4 of octet 5, is set to "1", then the DRX
parameter field is present, otherwise its octets are not present.

Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR (Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate) is coded as
Unsigned32 integer values in kbps (1000 bps) for all non-GBR bearers
according to the subscription of the user. The uplink/downlink Subscribed
UE AMBR requires converting values in bits per second to kilobits per
second when it is received from the HSS. If such conversions result in
fractions, then the uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR values shall be
rounded upwards. If SAMBRI (Subscribed UE AMBR Indicator), bit 1 of octet
6, is set to "1", then the Uplink/downlink Subscribed UE AMBR parameter
field is present, otherwise these parameters are not present. If no
Subscribed UE AMBR is received from the HSS, the SAMBRI shall be set to
"0".Uplink/downlink Used UE AMBR (Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate) is coded as
Unsigned32 integer values in kbps (1000 bps) for all non-GBR bearers
currently being used by the UE. If UAMBRI (Used UE AMBR Indicator), bit 2
of octet 6, is set to "1", then the Uplink/downlink Used UE AMBR parameter
field is present, otherwise these parameters are not present.

The encoding of Mobile Equipment Identity (MEI) field shall be same as
specified in clause 8.10 of this specification. If Length of Mobile
Equipment Identity is zero, then the Mobile Equipment Identity parameter
shall not be present. If the UE is emergency attached and the UE is
UICCless or the IMSI is unauthenticated, Mobile Equipment Identity (MEI)
shall be used as the UE identity.

The UE Network Capability coding is specified in clause 9.9.3.34 of 3GPP TS
24.301 [23]. If Length of UE Network Capability is zero, then the UE
Network Capability parameter shall not be present.

The MS Network Capability coding is specified in clause 10.5.5.12 of 3GPP
TS 24.008 [5]. If Length of MS Network Caapability is zero, then the MS
Network Capability parameter shall not be present.

The Voice Domain Preference and UE's Usage Setting coding is specified in
clause 10.5.5.28 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]. If Length of Voice Domain
Preference and UE's Usage Setting is zero, then the Voice Domain Preference
and UE's Usage Setting parameter shall not be present.

Used Cipher indicates the GSM ciphering algorithm that is in use.

Used NAS Cipher indicates the EPS ciphering algorithm that is in use.

The Access restriction data is composed of UNA(UTRAN Not Allowed),
GENA(GERAN Not Allowed), GANA(GAN Not Allowed), INA(I-HSPA-Evolution Not
Allowed), ENA(WB-E-UTRAN Not Allowed), NBNA( NB-IoT Not Allowed), ECNA
(Enhanced Coverage Not Allowed) and HNNA(HO-To-Non-3GPP-Access Not
Allowed).

If the SGSN support the Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag, the Higher
bitrates than 16 Mbps flag shall be included in the MM Context if:

  -  the source S4-SGSN has received "Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag" in
    the RANAP Initial UE Message or in RANAP Relocation Complete as defined
    in TS 25.413 [33] from the RNC, or

  -  the source S4-SGSN has stored the "Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag"
    (received from an SGSN via the Identification Response, Context
    Response or Forward Relocation Request during earlier procedures).

The S4-SGSN shall set the "Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag" to "1" if
"Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag" is "allowed" and to "0" if it is "not
allowed". The Length of Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag shall be set to
zero if the S4-SGSN has not received the "Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps
flag".

As depicted in Figure 8.38-1, the GSM Key, Used Cipher and Authentication
Triplets that are unused in the old SGSN shall be transmitted to the new
SGSN for the GSM subscribers. An array of at most 5 Authentication Triplets
may be included. The field 'Number of Triplet' shall be set to the value
'0'  if no Authentication Triplet is included (i.e. octets '16 to h' are
absent).

The Authentication Triplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-7.

As depicted in Figure 8.38-2, the UMTS Key, Used Cipher and Authentication
Quintuplets that are unused in the old SGSN shall be transmitted to the new
SGSN when the UMTS subscriber is attached to a GSM BSS in the old system,
in case the user has a ME capable of UMTS AKA. An array of at most 5
Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field 'Number of
Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quintuplet
is included (i.e. octets '40 to h' are absent).

If the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 3
of octet 6, is set to 1, then bits 4 to 6 of octet 7 shall contain the Used
GPRS integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be
set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

The GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 4 of octet 6, shall be
set to 1 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity
protection is required and set to 0 otherwise.

  NOTE 2:  The encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv1 as the
         spare bits are encoded differently.

The source S4-SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported
and available. The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a
length of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in
3GPP TS 43.020 [78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is
set to "1", then the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present,
otherwise it shall not be present.

The Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.

             Figure 8.38-3: GSM Key, Used Cipher and Quintuplets

As depicted in Figure 8.38-4, the UMTS Key, KSI and unused Authentication
Quintuplets in the old SGSN may be transmitted to the new SGSN/MME when the
UMTS subscriber is attached to UTRAN/GERAN in the old system, but it is not
allowed to send quintuplets to an MME in a different serving network domain
(see 3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6). The MME may forward the UMTS Key,
KSI and unused Authentication Quintuplets which were previously stored back
to the same SGSN, for further details, refer to 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. An
array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be included. The field
'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication
Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to h' are absent).

If the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 3
of octet 6, is set to 1, then bits 1 to 3 of octet 7 shall contain the Used
GPRS integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be
set to 0 and ignored by the receiver.

The GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 4 of octet 6, shall be
set to 1 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity
protection is required and set to 0 otherwise.

  NOTE 3:  The encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv1 as the
         spare bits are encoded differently.

The source S4-SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported
and available. The IOV_updates counter is encoded as an integer with a
length of 1 octet. The use of the IOV_updates counter is specified in
3GPP TS 43.020 [78]. If IOVI (IOV_updates Indicator), bit 5 of octet 6, is
set to "1", then the IOV_updates counter parameter field shall be present,
otherwise it shall not be present.

The Extended Access Restriction Data is to store the extra access
restriction data received from the HSS (other than ECNA, NBNA, HNNA, ENA,
INA, GANA, GENA and UNA). If Length of Extended Access Restriction Data is
zero, then the field of Extended Access Restriction Data shall not be
present. The Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as
Secondary RAT Not Allowed). The presence of the Extended Access Restriction
Data for the case in UMTS Key as depicted in Figure 8.38-4 is optional.

  NOTE:  In Figure 8.34-4, including the Extended Access Restriction Data
         allows optimized selection of SGW in case of handover from
         GSM/UTRAN to E-UTRAN.

The Authentication Quintuplet coding is specified in Figure 8.38-8.

                   Figure 8.38-4: UMTS Key and Quintuplets

As depicted in Figure 8.38-5, the current EPS Security Context, a non-
current EPS Security Context (if available), and unused Authentication
Quadruplets in the old MME may be transmitted to the new MME/AMF. If the
new MME/AMF is not in the same serving network domain, then only the
current EPS Security Context may be transmitted. The mapping of an EPS
security context to a 5G security context in the new AMF is specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may
be included. The field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value
'0'  if no Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '46 to g' are
absent). Authentication Quintuplets shall not be transmitted to the new
MME/AMF (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' shall be absent) even if the old MME has
the Authentication Quintuplets for this UE. The field 'Number of
Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The reasons for not sending
Quintuplets are specified in3GPP TS 33.401 [12] clause 6.1.6.

The current EPS Security Context may be transmitted by the old AMF to the
new MME, where the mapping of a 5G security context to an EPS security
context is specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [86]. The field 'Number of
Quadruplets' and 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'. The
AMF shall not transmit un-used authentication vectors to an MME and shall
discard any un-used authentication vectors received from an MME, regardless
of whether the MME and AMF pertain to the same or different serving network
domains.

The Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are
specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.

The value of the NAS Downlink Count shall be set to the value that shall be
used to send the next NAS message.

The value of the NAS Uplink Count shall be set to the largest NAS Uplink
Count that was in a successfully integrity verified NAS message.

In Figure 8.38-5, the fields for the Old EPS Security Context (i.e. octets
from s to s+64) may be present only in S10 Forward Relocation Request
message according to the Rules on Concurrent Running of Security
Procedures, which are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12]. The octets for Old
EPS Security Context shall be present if the OSCI (Old Security Context

present.

If NHI_old (Next Hop Indicator for old EPS Security Context), bit 1 of
octet s, is set to "1", then the parameters old NH (Next Hop) and old NCC
(Next Hop Chaining Count) shall be present; otherwise the octets for old NH
parameter shall not be present and the value of old NCC parameter shall be
ignored by the receiver.

If NHI (Next Hop Indicator), bit 5 of octet 5, is set to "1", then the
optional parameters NH (Next Hop) and NCC (Next Hop Chaining Count) are
both present, otherwise their octets are not present.

The UE Radio Capability for Paging information is specified in the
subclause 9.2.1.98 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]. If Length of UE Radio Capability
for Paging information is zero, then the UE Radio Capability for Paging
information shall not be present. The old MME shall, when available,
include UE Radio Capability for Paging information to the new MME as
specified in the subclause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [4].

The Extended Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA (NR as Secondary
RAT Not Allowed) and of USSRNA (Unlicensed Spectrum in the form of LAA or
LWA/LWIP as Secondary RAT Not Allowed).

The UE additional security capability coding is specified in clause
9.9.3.53 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23]. If Length of UE additional security
capability is zero, then the field UE additional security capability in
octets "(v+2) to x" shall not be present.

The UE NR security capability coding is specified in clause 9.8.3.57 of
3GPP TS 24.501 [87]. If Length of UE NR security capability is zero, then
the field UE NR security capability in octets "(x+2) to y" shall not be
present.

As depicted in Figure 8.38-6, the old MME will derive CK' and IK' from
KASME and transmit the CK' and IK' to the new SGSN. Authentication
Quintuplets, if available, shall be transmitted to the SGSN if, and only if
the MME received them from this SGSN earlier, according to 3GPP TS 33.401
[12] clause 6.1.5. An array of at most 5 Authentication Quintuplets may be
included. The field 'Number of Quintuplets' shall be set to the value '0'
if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets 'g+1 to h' are
absent). An array of at most 5 Authentication Quadruplets may be included.
The field 'Number of Quadruplets' shall be set to the value '0' if no
Authentication Quadruplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to g' are absent). A
key KASME shall never be transmitted to an SGSN according to 3GPP TS 33.401
[12] clause 6.4.

The Authentication Quintuplet and Authentication Quadruplet codings are
specified in Figure 8.38-8 and Figure 8.38-9 respectively.

The old SGSN/MME may deliver both Authentication Quadruplets and
Authentication Quintuplets it holds to the peer combo node to optimize the
procedure.

  NOTE:  3GPP TS 33.401 [12] states that "EPS authentication data shall not
         be forwarded from an MME towards an SGSN". The statement above
         assumes that the old MME can determine by local configuration that
         the peer node is a combo SGSN/MME (as opposed to a single SGSN).

8.39 PDN Connection

The PDN connection is a grouped IE containing a number of other IEs and
shall be coded as depicted in Table 8.39-1.

The PDN Connection IE may be repeated within a message when more than one
PDN Connection is required to be sent. If so, the repeated IEs shall have
exactly the same Instance values to represent a list of grouped IEs.

                  Table 8.39-1: PDN Connection Grouped Type

|Octet 1      |  |PDN Connection IE Type = 109        |           |   |

|NOTE:  This table uses a 5-column format in order to match the format|
|used in subclauses of clause 7, where the usage of this IE is further|
|detailed for each specific GTP message including it.                 |



8.40 PDU Numbers

The PDU Numbers information element contains the sequence number status
corresponding to a Bearer context in the old SGSN. This information element
shall be sent only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for
the Bearer context or when the "delivery order" QoS attribute is set in the
Bearer context QoS profile.

NSAPI identifies the Bearer context for which the PDU Number IE is
intended.

DL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next downlink GTP-U T-PDU to
be sent to the UE when "delivery order" is set.

UL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next uplink GTP-U T-PDU to
be tunnelled to the S-GW when "delivery order" is set.

The Send N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC
operation is used for the Bearer context. Send N-PDU Number is the N-PDU
number to be assigned by SNDCP to the next down link N-PDU received from
the S-GW.

The Receive N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC
operation is used for the Bearer context. The Receive N-PDU Number is the N-
PDU number expected by SNDCP from the next up link N-PDU to be received
from the UE.

The PDU Number IE will be repeated for each Bearer Context for which this
IE is required.

PDU Numbers IE is coded as depicted in Figure 8.40-1.

8.44 UE Time Zone

UE Time Zone is used to indicate the offset between universal time and
local time in steps of 15 minutes of where the UE currently resides. The
"Time Zone" field uses the same format as the "Time Zone" IE in 3GPP TS
24.008 [5].

UE Time Zone is coded as this is depicted in Figure 8.44-1. The value of
the Time Zone field represents the time zone adjusted for daylight saving
time. The value of the Daylight Saving Time field specifies the adjustment
that has been made.

The spare bits indicate unused bits, which shall be set to 0 by the sending
side and which shall not be evaluated by the receiving side.

indicate whether the F-Cause field contains RANAP Cause, BSSGP Cause or S1-
AP Cause.

All spare bits shall be set to zeros by the sender and ignored by the
receiver.

F-Cause field is coded as follows:

  -  For RANAP Cause, the F-Cause field shall contain a non-transparent
    copy of the cause value of the corresponding IE (see subclause 8.2.2),
    "Cause", as defined in clause 9.2.1.4 in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33].
    Cause Type field shall be ignored by the receiver. The value of F-Cause
    field (which has a range of 1..512) is transferred over the Iu
    interface and encoded into two octet as binary integer.

  -  For BSSGP Cause, the F-Cause field shall contain a non-transparent
    copy of the cause value of the corresponding IE (see subclause 8.2.2),
    "Cause", as defined in clause 11.3.8 in 3GPP TS 48.018 [34].
    Cause Type field shall be ignored by the receiver. The value of F-Cause
    field (which has a range of 0..255) is transferred over the Gb
    interface and encoded into one octet as binary integer.

  -  For S1-AP Cause, the F-Cause field shall contain a non-transparent
    copy of the cause value of the corresponding IE (see subclause 8.2.2),
    "Cause", as defined in clause 9.2.1.3 in 3GPP TS 36.413 [10].
    Cause Type field shall contain the RAN Cause subcategory as specified
    in 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] and it shall be encoded as in Table 8.49-1. The
    value of F-Cause field (and the associated RAN cause subcategory) is
    transferred over the S1-AP interface and encoded into one octet as
    binary integer.

mode. In this case the "Target ID" field shall contain a non-transparent
copy of the corresponding IEs (see subclause 8.2.2) and be encoded as
specified in Figure 8.51-1a below. The "Target RNC-ID" part of the "Target
ID" parameter is specified in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33].

  NOTE 1:  The ASN.1 parameter "Target ID" is forwarded non-transparently
         in order to maintain backward compatibility.

  NOTE 2:  The preamble of the "Target RNC-ID" (numerical value of e.g.
         0x20) shall not be included into octets 6 to (n+4). Also, the
         optional "iE-Extensions" parameter shall not be included into the
         GTP IE.

                  Figure 8.51-1a: Target ID for Type RNC ID

If only two digits are included in the MNC, then bits 5 to 8 of octet 7
(MNC digit 3) shall be coded as "1111".

The location area code (LAC) consists of 2 octets. Bit 8 of octet 9 is the
most significant bit and bit 1 of octet 10 is the least significant bit.
The coding of the location area code is the responsibility of each
administration. Coding using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not
ASCII encoding) shall be used.

The RNC-ID consists of 2 octets and contains 12 bits long value (see 3GPP
TS 25.413 [7]). Bit 4 of octet 12 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of
octet 13 is the least significant bit (bits 8 to 5 of octet 12 are set to
0). The coding of the RNC-ID is the responsibility of each administration.
Coding using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding)
shall be used.

The Extended RNC-ID consists of 2 octets and contains 16 bits long value
within the range 4096 to 65535. Bit 8 of octet a is the most significant
bit and bit 1 of octet (a+1) is the least significant bit. The coding of
the Extended RNC-ID is the responsibility of each administration. Coding
using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding) shall be
used. If the optional Extended RNC-ID is included, then the receiver shall
ignore the RNC-ID.

If the optional Extended RNC-ID is not included, then the length variable
'n' = 8 and the overall length of the IE is 13 octets. Otherwise, 'n' = 10
and the overall length of the IE is 15 octets.

  NOTE 3:  In the "TargetRNC-ID" ASN.1 type definition in 3GPP TS 25.413
         [7] the "RAC" parameter is marked as optional. RAC is however
         always available at an SGSN/MME when it sends the RAC in e.g. a
         GTPv2 Forward Relocation Request message.

    significant bit; all the bits of octet 10 shall be set to 0 by the
    sender and ignored by the receiver;

  -  if the gNodeB ID Length is between 22 and 31, other than 24, the most
    significant bit is the bit determined by the operation "gNodeB ID
    Length modulo 8", of octet 10 if the length is greater than 24, or of
    octet 11 if the length is smaller than 24. All the bits from bit 8 of
    octet 10 down to the most significant bit (excluded) shall be set to 0
    by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

The 5GS TAC consists of 3 octets. Bit 8 of Octet 14 is the most significant

                         Figure 8.54-1: RAB Context

The RAB Context IE may be repeated within a message with exactly the same
Type and Instance to represent a list.

The RAB context information element contains sequence number status for one
RAB in RNC, which corresponds to one PDP context. The RAB contexts are
transferred between the RNCs via the SGSNs at inter SGSN hard handover.

NSAPI identifies the PDP context and the associated RAB for which the RAB
context IE is intended.

DL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next downlink GTP-U T-PDU to
be sent to the UE.

UL GTP-U Sequence Number is the number for the next uplink GTP-U T-PDU to
be tunnelled to the SGW.

DL PDCP Sequence Number is the number for the next downlink PDCP-PDU to be
sent to the UE.

UL PDCP Sequence Number is the number for the next uplink PDCP-PDU to be
received from the UE.


8.55 Source RNC PDCP context info

The purpose of the Source RNC PDCP context info IE is to transfer RNC PDCP
context information from a source RNC to a target RNC during an SRNS
relocation.

The Target Cell ID shall be same as the Octets 3 to 10 of the Cell
Identifier IEI in 3GPP TS 48.018 [34].

Source Type values are specified in Table 8.59-1.

If the Source Type is Cell ID, this indicates PS handover from GERAN A/Gb
mode. In this case the coding of the Source ID field shall be same as the
Octets 3 to 10 of the Cell Identifier IEI in 3GPP TS 48.018 [34].

If the Source Type is RNC ID, this indicates PS handover from GERAN Iu mode
or for inter-RAT handover from UTRAN. In this case the Source ID field
shall include a transparent copy of the corresponding parameter (see
subclause 8.2.2), the Source RNC-ID as specified within the "Source ID"
parameter in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33].

  NOTE:  In fact, the ASN.1/PER encoded binary value of the "Source RNC ID"
         shall be copied into octets 14 to (n+4).

8.62 Fully qualified PDN Connection Set Identifier (FQ-CSID)

A fully qualified PDN Connection Set Identifier (FQ-CSID) identifies a set
of PDN connections belonging to an arbitrary number of UEs on a MME, SGW,
TWAN, ePDG or PGW. The FQ-CSID is used on S5, S8, S2a, S2b and S11
interfaces.

The size of CSID is two octets. The FQ-CSID is coded as follows:

                           Figure 8.62-1: FQ-CSID

Where Node-ID Type values are:

  0  indicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv4 address and p = 9.

  1  indicates that Node-ID is a global unicast IPv6 address and p = 21.

  2  indicates that Node-ID is a 4 octets long field with a 32 bit value
    stored in network order, and p= 9. The coding of the field is specified
    below:

  -  Most significant 20 bits are the binary encoded value of (MCC * 1000 +
    MNC).

  -  Least significant 12 bits is a 12 bit integer assigned by an operator
    to an MME, SGW, TWAN, ePDG or PGW. Other values of Node-ID Type are
    reserved.

Values of Number of CSID other than 1 are only employed in the Delete PDN
Connection Set Request.

The node that creates the FQ-CSID, (i.e. MME for MME FQ-CSID, SGW for SGW
FQ-CSID, TWAN for TWAN FQ-CSID, ePDG for ePDG FQ-CSID and PGW for PGW FQ-
CSID), is responsible for making sure the Node-ID is globally unique and
the CSID value is unique within that node.

When a FQ-CSID is stored by a receiving node, it is stored on a PDN basis
even for messages impacting only one bearer (i.e. Create Bearer Request).
See 3GPP TS 23.007 [17] for further details on the CSID and what specific
requirements are placed on the PGW, TWAN, ePDG, SGW and MME.

If with a Release Access Bearers Request, or Suspend Notification, or
Resume an SGW receives a semantically erroneus/unexpected Originating Node,
then the following applies:

  - If SGW has an active connection to an MME, but the Originating Node IE
    contains value "SGSN", then the SGW shall not release the user plane
    and shall send a response to the SGSN with some appropriate cause
    value.

  -  If SGW has an active connection to an S4-SGSN, but the Originating
    Node IE contains value "MME", then the SGW shall not release the user
    plane and shall send a response to the MME with some appropriate cause
    value.

a DNS message of section 3.1 of IETF RFC 1035 [31] but excluding the
trailing zero byte.

  NOTE 1:  The FQDN field in the IE is not encoded as a dotted string as
         commonly used in DNS master zone files.

A "PGW node name" IE in S3/S10/S16 GTP messages shall be a PGW host name as
per subclause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [32] when the PGW FQDN IE is
populated from 3GPP TS 29.303 [32] procedures. Specifically, the first DNS
label is either "topon" or "topoff", and the canonical node name of the PGW
starts at the third label. The same rules apply to "SGW node name" IE on
S3/S10/S16 and "SGW-U node name" IE on S5.

  NOTE 2:  The constraint of subclause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.303 format is on
         populating the IE by 3GPP nodes for 3GPP nodes, the receiver shall
         not reject an IE that is otherwise correctly formatted since the IE
         might be populated for a non-3GPP node.

An "MME node name" IE and an "SGSN node name" IE in S3 GTP messages
indicate the associated ISR node when the ISR becomes active.

8.73 MBMS IP Multicast Distribution

The MBMS IP Multicast Distribution IE is sent by the MBMS GW to the
MME/SGSN in the MBMS Session Start Request. Source Specific Multicasting is
used according to IETF RFC 4607 [40].

The IP Multicast Distribution Address and the IP Multicast Source Address
fields contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address. The Address Type and Address
Length fields shall be included in each field:

  - The Address Type, which is a fixed length code (of 2 bits) identifying
    the type of address that is used in the Address field.

  - The Address Length, which is a fixed length code (of 6 bits)
    identifying the length of the Address field.

  - The Address, which is a variable length field shall contain either an
    IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.

Address Type 0 and Address Length 4 shall be used when Address is an IPv4
address.

Address Type 1 and Address Length 16 shall be used when Address is an IPv6
address.

Other combinations of values are not valid.

MBMS HC Indicator represents an indication if header compression should be
used for MBMS user plane data, as specified in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33]. MBMS HC
Indicator field is encoded as a one octet long enumeration.

  NOTE:  Currently, 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] specifies two enumeration values: 0
         (indicates "uncompressed-header") and 1 (indicates "compressed-
         header").

Common Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is allocated at the source Tunnel
Endpoint and signalled to the destination Tunnel Endpoint. There is one
Common Tunnel Endpoint Identifier allocated per MBMS bearer service. The
recommendations on how to set the value of C-TEID are provided in 3GPP TS
23.246 [37].

  NOTE:  Due to a specification oversight, the CMI values in the above
         table are reversed from the values of the CSG-Membership-Indication
         AVP in 3GPP TS 32.299 [54], as well as from the values of the CMI
         in the UCI IE (see subclause 8.75). Therefore, when the above CMI
         values are sent over the charging interface, the values are encoded
         as specified in 3GPP TS 32.299 [54].

                       Figure 8.100-1: TWAN Identifier

The BSSID and SSID shall be encoded as described in IEEE Std 802.11-2012
[52].

The TWAN identifier shall contain the SSID and, unless otherwise determined
by the TWAN operator’s policies, it shall contain at least the BSSID, the
civic address of the access point to which the UE is attached or the
Circuit-ID with the identity of the Relay (e.g. TWAG) which has allocated
it (see subclause 16.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [45]). It may also contain the
identifier of the TWAN operator, i.e. either the TWAN PLMN-ID if the TWAN
is operated by a mobile operator or the TWAN Operator Name otherwise.

The SSID Length in octet '6' indicates the length of the SSID field. The
SSID is an Octet String which shall have a maximum length of 32 octets (see
IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [52]).

The BSSIDI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the BSSID in octets 'k+1' to
'k+6' shall be present. If BSSIDI is set to '1', then the BSSID shall be
present. If BSSIDI is set to '0', then the BSSID shall not be present. The
BSSID is an Octet String which shall be 6 octets long (see IEEE Std 802.11-
2012 [52]).

The CIVAI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Civic Address Length and
Civic Address Information in octets 'q' and 'q+1' to 'q+r' shall be
present. The Civic Address Length and Information shall be present if and
only if the CIVAI flag is set to 1. When present, the Civic Address
Information shall contain the civic address of the Access Point to which
the UE is attached and it shall be encoded as defined in subclause 3.1 of
IETF RFC 4776 [59] excluding the first 3 octets.

The PLMNI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the TWAN PLMN-ID in octets 's'
to 's+2' shall be present. The TWAN PLMN-ID shall be present if and only if
the PLMNI flag is set to 1. The TWAN PLMN-ID shall be encoded as octets 5
to 7 of the Serving Network IE in subclause 8.18. When present, the TWAN
PLMN-ID shall indicate the PLMN-ID of the TWAN operator.

  NOTE:  the PLMN ID contained in the TWAN PLMN-ID can differ from the PLMN
         ID in the Serving Network IE.

The OPNAI flag in octet 5 indicates whether the TWAN Operator Name Length
and TWAN Operator Name in octets 't' and 't+1' to 't+u' shall be present.
The TWAN Operator Name Length and TWAN Operator Name shall be present if
and only if the OPNAI flag is set to 1. The TWAN Operator Name shall be
encoded as specified in subclause 19. 8 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]. When
present, the TWAN Operator Name shall indicate the identifier of the TWAN
operator.

The LAII flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Logical Access ID
information is present in the TWAN Identifier IE. The Logical Access ID is
encoded by the Relay Identity information in octets 'v' to 'v+w' and the
Circuit-ID information in octets 'x' to 'x+y'. The Relay Identity
information and the Circuit-ID information shall be present if the LAII
flag is set to '1'. The Relay indicates a DHCP relay agent as defined in
IETF RFC 3046 [60]. The Relay Identity Type indicates the type of the Relay
Identity as described in Table 8.100-1. The Relay Identity Length indicates
the length of the Relay Identity. In case the Relay Identity Type indicates
an IP address, the length indicates if it is IPv4 or IPv6 address of the
Relay. The length is 4 octets for IPv4 and 16 octets for IPv6. If the Relay
Identity type is set to 1 (i.e. an FQDN), it is encoded as described in
section 3.1 of IETF RFC 1035 [31] but excluding the trailing zero byte. The
Circuit-ID length indicates the length of the Circuit-ID. The Circuit-ID is
as defined in IETF RFC 3046 [60], it is encoded as an Octetstring and
provided by the Relay.

                     Table 8.100-1: Relay Identity Type

|Relay Identity Type    |Values (Decimal)       |
|IPv4 or IPv6 Address   |0                      |

The Action value 1 (Start Reporting change) shall be used to request to
start reporting changes of UE presence in the Presence Reporting Area
identified by the Presence Reporting Area Identifier and, if present, the
Presence Reporting Area elements composing the Presence Reporting Area.

The Action value 2 (Stop Reporting change) shall be used to request to stop
reporting changes of UE presence in a Presence Reporting Area.

The Action value 3 (Modify Presence Reporting Area elements composing the
PRA) shall be used to request to modify the Presence Reporting Area
elements composing the PRA and to continue reporting changes of UE presence
in that Presence Report Area.

The Inactive PRA (INAPRA) flag in the Octet 5 shall be set to 1 on the
S10/S16/S3 interface if the PRA is inactive in the source MME/SGSN during
an inter MME/SGSN mobility procedure, i.e. the reporting change of UE
presence in this Presence Reporting Area was requested by the PGW/PCRF/OCS
but it was deactivated by the source MME/SGSN, e.g. due to an overload
situation.

The Presence Reporting Area Identifier shall be present if the Action value
requests to start, stop or modify reporting changes of UE presence in a
Presence Reporting Area. If so, the Presence Reporting Area Identifier
shall contain an identifier of the Presence Reporting Area and be encoded
using full hexadecimal representation(binary, not ASCII encoding). The
Presence Reporting Area Identifier is defined in subclause 19.10 of 3GPP TS
23.003 [2].

Octets 9 to 14 shall be present if the Action value requests to start
reporting change of UE presence in a Presence Reporting Area and the
Presence Reporting Area is not pre-configured in the MME/SGSN, or the
Action value requests to modify the Presence Reporting Area elements
composing a Presence Reporting Area not pre-configured in the MME/SGSN. If
so, these octets shall indicate the number of TAI (15 at most), Macro
eNodeB ID (63 at most), Home eNodeB ID (63 at most), ECGI (63 at most), RAI
(15 at most), SAI (63 at most) and CGI (63 at most) which compose the PRA.

TAIs in octets 15 to 'k', if any, shall be encoded as per the TAI field in
subclause 8.21.4. Octets 15 to 'k' shall be absent if the field 'Number of
TAI' is set to the value '0'.

Macro eNB IDs in octets 'k+1' to 'm', if any, shall be encoded as per
octets 6 to 11 of the Target ID for type Macro eNodeB in figure 8.51-2.
Octets 'k+1' to 'm' shall be absent if the field 'Number of Macro eNodeB'
is set to the value '0'.

Home eNB IDs in octets 'm+1' to 'p', if any, shall be encoded as per octets
6 to 12 of the Target ID for type Home eNodeB in figure 8.51-3. Octets
'm+1' to 'p' shall be absent if the field 'Number of Home eNodeB' is set to
the value '0'.

ECGIs in octets 'p+1' to 'q', if any, shall be encoded as per the ECGI
field in subclause 8.21.5. Octets 'p+1' to 'q' shall be absent if the field
'Number of ECGI' is set to the value '0'.

RAIs in octets 'q+1' to 'r', if any, shall be encoded as per the RAI field
in subclause 8.21.3. Octets 'q+1' to 'r' shall be absent if the field
'Number of RAI' is set to the value '0'.

SAIs in octets 'r+1' to 's', if any, shall be encoded as per the SAI field
in subclause 8.21.2. Octets 'r+1' to 's' shall be absent if the field
'Number of SAI' is set to the value '0'.

CGIs in octets 's+1' to 't', if any, shall be encoded as per the CGI field
in subclause 8.21.1. Octets 's+1' to 't' shall be absent if the field
'Number of CGI' is set to the value '0'.

Extended Macro eNB IDs in octets 't+2' to 'v', if any, shall be encoded as
per octets 6 to 11 of the Target ID for type Extended Macro eNodeB in
figure 8.51-x. Octets 't+2' to 'v' shall be absent if the field 'Number of

The PRA Identifier in octets 5 to 7 shall be present and shall contain the
identifier of the PRA the UE is entering or leaving. It shall be encoded
using full hexadecimal representation (binary, not ASCII encoding). The PRA
Identifier is defined in subclause 19.10 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

The PRA Identifier in the Octets 5 to 7 shall be set to the PRA Set ID if
the MME/SGSN is requested to report the change of UE presence in a PRA Set.
In this case:

  -  the Additional PRA (APRA) flag in octet 8 shall be set to 1 if the
    reporting of change of UE presence for the PRA Set is active and the UE
    presence has changed for at least one PRA within the PRA Set (i.e. if
    the UE enters or leaves the PRA Set, or the UE moves between the PRAs
    within the PRA Set). The subsequent 4 octets shall then be present and
    shall contain the identifier of the individual PRA within the PRA Set
    which the UE has newly entered or left, with the information of whether
    the UE is inside or outside this PRA.

  -  the Additional PRA (APRA) flag in octet a+3 shall be set to 1 if the
    UE presence status has changed for more than one individual PRA within
    the PRA Set. In that case, the subsequent 4 Octets shall be included
    and encoded as specified above for the octets a to a+3. The MME/SGSN
    shall report each individual PRA(s) within the PRA Set that the UE has
    newly entered or left.

  -  if the reporting of change of UE presence for the PRA Set is inactive,
    i.e. the INAPRA flag in octet 8 is set to 1, then the Additional PRA
    (APRA) flag in octet 8 shall not be set to 1 and no Additional PRA
    Identifier shall be included.

The Inside PRA flag (IPRA) shall be set to 1 if the UE is inside or enters
the Presence Reporting Area identified by the PRA Identifier.

The Outside PRA flag (OPRA) shall be set to 1 if the UE is outside or
leaves the Presence Reporting Area identified by the PRA Identifier.

The Inactive PRA (INAPRA) flag in octet 8 shall be set to 1 if the PRA is
inactive in the MME/SGSN, i.e. the reporting of change of UE presence in
this PRA is currently deactivated in the MME/SGSN, e.g. due to an overload
situation.

Either the IPRA or the OPRA flag or the INAPRA shall be set to 1, not
several ones, for a given Presence Reporting Area Identifier.


8.110  TWAN Identifier Timestamp

The TWAN Identifier Timestamp IE is coded as shown in Figure 8.110-1. It
indicates the UTC time when the TWAN Identifier information was acquired.
Octets 5 to 8 shall be encoded in the same format as the first four octets
of the 64-bit timestamp format as defined in section 6 of IETF RFC 5905
[53].

  NOTE:  The encoding is defined as the time in seconds relative to
         00:00:00 on 1 January 1900.

                  Figure 8.134-1: Maximum Packet Loss Rate

The UL flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Maximum Packet Loss Rate UL
value in octets 'm to m+1' shall be present. If UL is set to '1', then the
Maximum Packet Loss Rate UL value shall be present. If UL is set to '0',
then octets 'm to m+1' shall not be present.

The DL flag in octet 5 indicates whether the Maximum Packet Loss Rate DL
value in octets 'o to o+1' shall be present. If DL is set to '1', then the
Maximum Packet Loss Rate DL value shall be present. If DL is set to '0',
then octets 'o to o+1' shall not be present.

The Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL shall be coded as an unsigned
integer in the range of 0 to 1000. It shall be interpreted as Ratio of lost
packets per number of packets sent, expressed in tenth of percent.


9  Security

GTPv2-C communications shall be protected according to security mechanisms
defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [12].


10 IP - The Networking Technology used by GTP


10.1 IP Version

GTPv2 entities shall support both versions of the Internet Protocol,
version 4 (IPv4) as defined by IETF RFC 791 [6], and version 6 (IPv6) as
defined by IETF RFC 2460 [16].


10.2 IP Fragmentation

It is specified here how the fragmentation mechanism shall work with GTP-C.

Fragmentation should be avoided if possible. Examples of fragmentation
drawbacks are:

  -  Fragmentation is inefficient, since the complete IP header is
    duplicated in each fragment.

  -  If one fragment is lost, the complete packet has to be discarded. The
    reason is that no selective retransmission of fragments is possible.

 Path MTU discovery should be used, especially if GTPv2-C message is
encapsulated with IPv6 header. The application should find out the path
MTU, and thereby utilise more efficient fragmentation mechanisms.


10.3 DSCP

Based on operator policy, if:

  -  GTPv2 entities support using the GTPv2 message priority mechanism as
    specified in subclause 5.4 and subclause 12.3.9.3.4 for DSCP marking,

  -  the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and

  -  message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack for
    transporting GTPv2 messages,

then the DSCP marking as defined by IETF RFC 2474 [81] shall be set for IP
packet carrying this GTPv2 messages based on the priority set in the GTPv2
message header.


11 Notification of supported features between peer GTP-C entities


11.1 General


11.1.1 Introduction

New functionality, i.e. functionality beyond the Rel-9 standard, which can
not be specified without backward incompatible changes (e.g. requiring
support of a new message or a specific receiver node's behaviour) should be
introduced as a feature, see subclause 11.1.2.

A GTP-C entity should verify that a backward incompatible feature is
supported by its peer GTP entities before starting to use it.

  NOTE:  GTPv2 does not support a Comprehension Required mechanism allowing
         a sender to force the receiver to support comprehension of some
         specific IEs as a precondition to process a backward incompatible
         message.

Features may be generic node capabilities supported homogeneously for all
GTP tunnels, UEs and PDN connections. Such features are referred in this
specification as "Node Features". They are signalled with the granularity
of a node on all GTPv2 interfaces (i.e. S11, S4, S5, S8, S10, S3, S16, Sv,
S101, S121, Sm, Sn, S2a, S2b). A GTP-C entity may discover the features
supported by a peer GTP-C entity with which it is in direct contact as
specified in subclause 11.2.1.


11.1.2 Defining a feature

A feature is a function extending the base GTPv2 functionality that has a
significant meaning to the operation of GTPv2, i.e. a single new parameter
without a substantial meaning to the functionality of the GTPv2 endpoints
should not be defined to be a new feature.

A functionality requiring the definition of a new GTPv2 message or
extending the use of an existing message over a new interface should be
defined as a feature.

  NOTE:  Features are ultimately defined on a case-by-case basis on the
         merits of defining an extension as a feature.

Features should be defined so that they are independent from each other. A
GTP-C entity may support the same feature over different interfaces, e.g.
an SGW may support a feature over both S11 and S4 interface, however
support of a feature on a given interface shall not depend on the support
of the same or another feature on another interface.


11.2 Dynamic discovery of supported features


11.2.1 General

A node supporting at least one feature defined in the Node Features IE
shall support dynamic discovery of supported features as specified in the
following subclauses.


11.2.2 Features supported by direct peer GTP-C entities

A node shall signal to a direct peer node the list of features it supports
by sending the Sending Node Features IE in every Echo Request and Echo
Response messages to that node.

An exception to this is where the sending node does not support or use any
features towards the peer node and is not prepared to accept a message
which is constructed by making use of any features.

The peer receiving the Sending Node Features IE shall store the list of
features supported by the sending node per IP address and only update this
list based on the Sending Node Features IE in the Echo Request and Echo
Response messages, and it shall only use common supported features to
initiate subsequent GTPv2 messages towards this IP address. Receipt of an
Echo Request or an Echo Response message without the Sending Node Features
IE shall indicate that the sending node does not support any feature
specified in Table 8.83-1 on the corresponding interface.


12 GTP-C load & overload control mechanism


12.1 General


12.1.1 GTP-C overload problem

GTP-C entities can communicate with other GTP-C peers in direct contact
(e.g. MME and SGW) or remote GTP-C peers through intermediate GTP-C
entities (e.g. MME and PGW via the SGW). In normal conditions, requests
sent by a GTP-C entity can be processed by the receiving GTP-C entity which
can send back a message indicating the result of the request
(success/failure).

Overload situations in a GTP-C entity occur when the number of incoming
requests exceeds the maximum request throughput supported by the receiving
GTP-C entity, e.g. when the internal available resources of the GTP-C
entity, such as processing power or memory, are not sufficient to serve the
number of incoming requests. As a consequence of the overload situation,
the receiving GTP-C entity cannot successfully process the exceeding
proportion of requests. These requests can be either simply dropped or
extremely delayed in the processing. At best, the GTP-C entity may have
enough internal resources to send back to the request initiator a message
indicating that the requests cannot be successfully processed. Whatever the
behaviour of the overloaded GTP-C entities, the rate of successfully
processed requests and consequently the overall performances of the network
decrease.

  NOTE:  GTP-C overload control does not target to address transport
         network congestion. It assumes a transport network that is still
         capable to exchange signalling traffic.

Given the nature of GTP-C protocol in how it relies on retransmissions of
unacknowledged requests (GTP-C is carried over UDP transport), when a GTP-C
entity experiences overload (or severe overload) the number of
unacknowledged GTP-C messages compounds exponentially and can lead to a
node congestion or even collapse. An overload or failure of a node can lead
to an increase of the load on the other nodes in the network and, in the
worst case, turn into a complete network issue via a snowball effect.

The impact of GTP-C overload to services can be such as:

  -  loss of PDN connectivity (IMS, Internet …) and associated services;

  -  loss of ability to setup and release radio and core network bearers
    necessary to support services e.g. GBR bearers for VoLTE or dedicated
    bearers for Voice over WLAN;

  -  loss of ability to report to the PGW/PCRF user's information changes,
    e.g. location information for emergency services and lawful intercept,
    changes in RAT or QoS;

  -  and billing errors and a loss of revenue.


12.1.2 Scenarios leading to overload

Reasons for these temporary overload cases can be many and various in an
operational network, such as insufficient internal resource capacity of a
GTP-C entity faced with a sudden burst of requests, e.g. after network
failure/restart procedures affecting a large number of users, deficiency of
a GTP-C entity component leading to a drastic reduction of the overall
performances of the GTP-C entity.

Examples of GTP-C signalling based scenarios which can cause GTP-C overload
are:

  -  a traffic flood resulting from the failure of a network element,
    inducing a signalling spike, e.g. when the network needs to re-
    establish the PDN connections affected by the failure of an EPC node;

  -  a traffic flood resulting from a large number of users performing
    TAU/RAU or from frequent transitions between idle and connected mode;

  -  an exceptional event locally generating a traffic spike, e.g. a large
    amount of calls (and dedicated bearers) being setup almost
    simultaneously upon a catastrophic event or an exceptional but
    predictable event (e.g. Christmas, New year) via a 3GPP access or a
    WLAN access;

  -  Frequent RAT-reselection due to scattered non-3GPP (e.g. WiFi)
    coverage or massive mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP coverage may
    potentially cause frequent or massive intersystem change activities,
    i.e. UEs trying to either create  PDN connections over the new access
    or moving PDN connections between 3GPP and non-3GPP coverage.

Besides, GTP-C load balancing based only on semi-static DNS weights can
lead to a load imbalance and thus GTP-C signalling scenarios, such as those
mentioned above, may result in an overload of the SGWs or PGWs with the
highest load while there is still remaining capacity on other SGWs or PGWs.


12.1.3 Load & overload control concepts

Load control refers to "GTP-C signalling based Load Control" as defined in
subclause 4.3.7.1a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP
TS 23.060 [35].

Overload control refers to "GTP-C signaling based Overload Control" as
defined in subclause 4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and subclause
5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35].

Load control and overload control are two distinct but complementary
concepts:

  -  load control enables a GTP-C entity (e.g. an SGW/PGW) to send its load
    information to a GTP-C peer (e.g. an MME/SGSN, ePDG, TWAN) to
    adaptively balance the session load across entities supporting the same
    function (e.g. an SGW cluster) according to their effective load. The
    load information reflects the operating status of the resources of the
    GTP-C entity.

  -  overload control enables a GTP-C entity becoming or being overloaded
    to gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its
    GTP-C peers to reduce sending traffic according to its available
    signalling capacity to successfully process the traffic. A GTP-C entity
    is in overload when it operates over its signalling capacity which
    results in diminished performance (including impacts to handling of
    incoming and outgoing traffic).

Load control allows for better balancing of the session load, so as to
attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action).
Overload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the
traffic source as possible generally when an overload has occurred
(reactive action), so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and
to avoid using resources of intermediate nodes in the network for
signalling that would anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.

Load control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the GTP-C
entity reports a high load.

Load control and overload control may be supported and activated
independently in the network.


12.2 Load control solution


12.2.1 Principles of load control

The stage 2 requirements on GTP-C load control solution are defined in
clause 4.3.7.1a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS
23.060 [35]. The high level principles are summarized below:

  a) Load Control is an optional feature;

  b) a GTP-C node may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the
    operating status of its resources, allowing the receiving GTP-C peer
    node to use this information to augment the existing GW selection
    procedures;

  c) the calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation
    dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant
    additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes;

  d) the Load Control Information may provide load information of a GTP-C
    node (e.g. a PGW) or, if the APN level load control feature is
    supported, may provide the load information about specific APN(s);

  e) the SGW may send its Load Control Information to the MME/S4-SGSN. The
    PGW may send its Load Control Information to the MME/S4-SGSN via the
    SGW. For non-3GPP access based interfaces, the PGW may send its Load
    Control Information to the ePDG and TWAN;

  f) the Load Control Information shall be piggybacked in GTP-C request or
    response messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information
    does not trigger extra signalling;

  NOTE:  The inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages
         means that the frequency of transmission of load control
         information increases as the session load increases, allowing for
         faster feedback and thus better regulation of the load.

  g) a node supporting Load Control sends Load Control Information to a
    peer GTP-C node based on local configuration (see clause 12.2.6);

  h) the format of the Load Control Information shall be specified with
    enough precision to guarantee a common interpretation of this
    information allowing interoperability between nodes of different
    vendors;

  i) for the inter-PLMN case, local configuration may restrict the exchange
    and use of Load Control Information across PLMNs;

  j) the GTP-C node may decide to send different values of Load Control
    Information on inter-network (roaming) and on intra-network (non-
    roaming) interfaces based on local configuration, i.e. the values sent
    on intra-network interfaces may differ from the values sent on inter-
    network interfaces. However, on intra-network interfaces, the node
    should send the same values between the 3GPP and non-3GPP access based
    interfaces.

  k) the Load Control Information received via GTP-C signalling shall be
    used in conjunction with the information received from the DNS, during
    the node selection procedure. Refer to 3GPP TS 29.303 [32] for further
    details.


12.2.2 Applicability to 3GPP and non-3GPP access based interfaces

Load Control may be supported on the 3GPP & non-3GPP access based
interfaces and nodes as summarized by the Table 12.2.2-1.

 Table 12.2.2-1: Applicability of Load Control to GTP-C interfaces and nodes

|Originator|Consumer   |Applicable Interfaces                      |

|          |           |SGW relays Load Control Information from   |
|          |           |S5/S8 to S11 interface.                    |

|          |           |S5/S8 to S4 interface.                     |
|SGW       |MME        |S11                                        |
|SGW       |S4-SGSN    |S4                                         |
|PGW       |ePDG       |S2b                                        |
|PGW       |TWAN       |S2a                                        |


  NOTE:  Refer to Annex D.1 for information on the GTP-C interfaces for
         which Load Control is not supported.


12.2.3 Node level load control

Node level load control refers to advertising of the load information at
node level – i.e. load information at node level granularity – and
selection of the target node based on this information. It helps to achieve
an evenly load balanced network by the use of the dynamic load information
provided within the Load Control Information.


12.2.4 APN level load control


12.2.4.1 General

APN level load control refers to advertising of the load information at APN
level granularity and selection of the target node based on this
information. It helps to achieve an evenly load balanced network at APN
granularity by the use of the dynamic load information provided within the
Load Control Information with the APN scope. Only a PGW may advertise APN
level load information.

APN level load control is an optional feature that may be supported when
the following pre-condition is applicable.

Pre-Condition:

     In the given network, when the ratio of the configured APN resource to
    the overall capacity of the PGW is not the same across all the PGWs in
    the network.

  NOTE:  In other cases, e.g. when all the resources of the PGW are
         available for all the APNs served by that PGW, the node level load
         information is exactly the same as APN level load information, for
         each of its APNs, and hence performing node load control is
         sufficient.

If APN load control is supported and activated at the PGW, the PGW should
advertise the APN load information. If the APN level load control feature
is supported at the node performing the PGW selection, i.e. an MME, S4-
SGSN, ePDG, TWAN, the node shall utilize this information when selecting
the PGW.


12.2.4.2 Justifications for APN load control support

Following are the justifications to support the APN level load control in
the network when the pre-condition specified in 12.2.3.1 is applicable:

  1) To achieve load balancing at the APN level granularity: The PGW may be
    configured to handle more than one APN in the network. In such a case,
    the PGW may be additionally configured to allocate different resources
    for each of the configured APNs, e.g. the PGW may be configured to
    handle "X" number of sessions for the "consumer" APN and to handle "Y"
    number of session for the "corporate" APN. The ratio of this limit,
    i.e. "X" and "Y", to the PGW's capacity may not be the same across all
    the PGWs in the network. In this case, the load information with node
    level granularity is not sufficient and could result in a network where
    one PGW has more sessions for the "consumer" APN while another PGW has
    more sessions for the "corporate" APN. Thus, an evenly load balanced
    network at APN level load granularity cannot be realized.

  2) To ensure effective overload control in the network: If the
    distribution of sessions at APN level is uneven, then there is a higher
    risk of overload of some PGWs, as compared to other PGWs, e.g. the PGW
    handling more sessions for "consumer" APN may have to handle more
    messages, (e.g. generated due to mobility events resulting from a
    change of ULI, RAT type, Serving GW, etc.) as compared to the PGW
    handling more sessions for the "stationary-machine" APN. Hence, the PGW
    handling "consumer" APN sessions may be at higher risk of overload, as
    compared to the other PGWs in the network, and hence, this situation
    may result in poor overload control of the network.

  3) To ensure an efficient node selection algorithm: Based on the node
    level load information, the source node, (e.g. the MME) may end-up
    selecting the PGW for a new session for the given APN. However, the
    selected PGW may reject the new session request, if it is running at
    100% load capacity for the given APN, or the new session request may be
    throttled by the source node based on the overload information of the
    APN for the given PGW. Thus the new session request may be denied,
    (i.e. rejected by the selected PGW or throttled by the source node
    based on PGW's APN level overload information) while the other PGW may
    have the capacity to handle the same. Thus, the lack of APN level load
    information may result in inefficient node selection algorithm by the
    source node.


12.2.4.3 Elements of APN load control

To allow for an effective APN load control, at least the following
information (in addition to the other applicable information for load
control as defined in clause 12.2.5.1.2) is required to be advertised by
the PGW, as part of the APN level load information:

APN: The APN for which the PGW wants to advertise the load information.

APN-Load-Metric: It indicates the current resource utilization for a
particular APN, as a percentage, compared to the total resources reserved
for that APN at the target PGW. Its computation is implementation dependent
and it has same characteristics as "Load-Metric", as described in clause
12.2.5.1.2.2, when applied at the APN level.

APN-relative-capacity: It indicates the total resources configured for a
given APN, compared to the total resources of the target PGW, as a
percentage. It is a static parameter and does not change unless the
resources configured for the APN change. Using APN-relative-capacity and
the DNS weight-factor of the given PGW, the source node can judge the PGW's
APN related resources as compared other PGWs in the network, i.e. the PGW's
APN-weight-factor can be calculated by multiplying the APN-relative-
capacity and DNS-weight-factor of the PGW (PGW's-APN-weight-factor = PGW's-
APN-relative-capacity X DNS-weight-factor).

For the following example configuration:

   PGW1-APN1-relative-capacity = 50%; PGW2-APN1- relative-capacity = 20%;
PGW3-APN1- relative-capacity = 10%

   PGW1-weight-factor = 20; PGW2-weight-factor = 20; PGW3-weight-factor =
60;

The APN level weight-factor for each of the PGWs can be calculated as
below:

  PGW1-APN1-weight-factor = 50% X 20 = 10.

  PGW2-APN1-weight-factor = 20% X 20 = 4.

  PGW3-APN1-weight-factor = 10% X 60 = 6.

Thus, based on the APN-weight-factor it can be concluded that the PGW1 has
highest APN1 related resources reserved, as compared to the other PGWs in
the network. Hence the source node should use this information to favour
PGW1 over other PGWs for APN1 related new session requests.


12.2.5 Load Control Information


12.2.5.1 Definition


12.2.5.1.1  General description

Within a message, one or multiple instances of the Load Control Information
(LCI) IE may be included by the same GTP-C entity.

When providing load control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the GTP-C entity shall always include the full set of load
control information, i.e. all the node level and APN Level applicable
instances of the Load Control Information, even if only a subset of the
load control information has changed. All the instances of the LCI IE
provided by a given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain the same Load-
Control-Sequence-Number. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be
incremented whenever the load control information is changed (see subclause
12.2.5.1.2.1).

The receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer
with the newly received load control information (via one or multiple
instances) from the same peer node if the new load control information is
more recent than the old information as indicated by the Load Control
Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored 'X' instances of the load
control information for a peer node, it overwrites those 'X' instances with
the new set of 'Y' instances received in a message from the same peer node,
where X, Y are any integer number.

The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same
instance of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for node
selection. When more than one instance of the LCI IE is received, the
receiver shall consider the parameters included in each instance
independently, when using this information for node selection.

The parameters are further defined in subclauses 12.2.5.1.2 and 12.2.5.1.3.

Load control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be
categorized as:

  - Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is
    not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and
    correctly comprehend the load control information instance, containing
    one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and
    ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.

  - Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is
    critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the
    load control information containing one or more of these parameters.

The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within
any instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one
or more critical optional parameter in any instance of the LCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those
parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods
or by configuration; (this will have to be defined when introducing any
such new parameter in future).

Each instance of the LCI IE shall be associated to the node identity (FQDN
or IP address of the GW node received from the HSS or the DNS) of the
serving SGW or PGW, i.e. the identity determined during the SGW or PGW
selection.

  NOTE:  The Node type is derived based on the instance number of the LCI
         IE.


12.2.5.1.2  Parameters


12.2.5.1.2.1  Load Control Sequence Number

The Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the
sequence number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be
used to differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances
by the same GTP-C entity. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be
supported (if load control is supported) and shall always be present in the
LCI IE.

The GTP-C entity generating  this information shall increment the Load
Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load
Control Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be
incremented otherwise. The node may use the time, represented in an
unsigned integer format, of the generation of the Load Control Information
to populate the Load Control Sequence Number.

When multiple instances of the LCI IE are provided in a message by a given
GTP-C node, each of them shall contain the same Load Control Sequence
Number value.

This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control
Information IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information,
e.g. due to GTP-C retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the
receiver of the LCI IE to determine whether the newly received load control
information has changed compared to load control information previously
received from the same node earlier.

  NOTE:  The GTP-C sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-
         order load control information as e.g. load control information may
         be sent in both GTP-C requests and responses, using independent GTP-
         C sequence numbering.

If the receiving entity has already received and stored load control
information from the peer GTP-C entity, the receiving entity shall update
its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number
received in the new load control information is higher than the stored
value of the Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer GTP-C
entity. However due to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or
restart of the node, the Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an
appropriate base value by the peer GTP-C entity, hence the receiving entity
shall be prepared to receive (and process) a Load Control Sequence Number
parameter whose value is less than the previous value.


12.2.5.1.2.2  Load Metric

The Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the
originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to
implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as: the used
capacity of the node based on activated bearers in relationship to maximum
number of bearers the node can handle, the load that these active bearers
produce in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in relationship to the total
memory/CPU available, etc.).

The Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a
percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100
means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).

The Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load
Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.

Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control
Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node
selection algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender
should refrain from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the
granularity of 1 or 2), in the Load Metric which does not result in useful
improvement in node selection logic at the receiver. During the typical
operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric,
e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for
advertising the new Load Control Information and thus justifying the
processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.

  NOTE:  The range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the
         sender to collect its own load information at every
         increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Load
         Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation
         specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and
         signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free
         to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own load
         information is collected.


12.2.5.1.2.3  List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity

The List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity parameter contains a list of the
tuple (APN, Relative Capacity) and this indicates one or more APNs for
which the Load Control Information is applicable. The "APN" contains the
name of the APN and the Relative Capacity indicates the resources
configured for a given APN, compared to the total resources configured at
the target PGW, as a percentage.

When present in the LCI IE, the scope of the load information shall be the
list of indicated APNs for the PGW that sends the load control information.
In that case, the "Load Metric" shall be interpreted as an "APN-Load-
Metric" and shall indicate the current resource utilization for the
indicated APNs, as a percentage, as compared to the total resources
configured for the indicated APNs at the target PGW.

Its computation is implementation dependent and it has the same
characteristics as "Load Metric". Only one instance of the List-Of-
APN_and_Relative Capacity IE may be included within one Load Control
Information instance.

  NOTE 1:  The maximum number of tuples (APN, Relative Capacity) in the
         List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE is set to 10. More than 10
         occurrences of (APN, Relative Capacity), within one single instance
         of the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE is treated as protocol
         error by the receiver.

If the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity IE has not been included, the
scope of the Load Control Information shall be the entire PGW node (unless
restricted by other parameters in the LCI IE).

This parameter may be supported (if load control is supported) and shall be
supported when APN level load control is supported.

The receiver shall handle this parameter, when it is received, if it
supports APN level load control. The receiver shall ignore a Load Control
Information instance applicable for an APN, if it does not support APN
level load control.

  NOTE 2:  The PGW encodes the APN level load information and node level
         load information using different instance numbers in the message,
         so that the receiver will ignore the APN level load information, if
         it does not support the APN level load control feature.

The maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Load
Control Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of
occurrences of the tuple (APN, Relative Capacity) within and across various
instances of the LCI IE shall be limited to 10, for a given PGW. Hence, if
the PGW supports more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the load control
information for at most 10 of the most important APNs. In future, if
needed, this limit may be increased to allow the PGW to advertise the load
information for more APNs. In that case, the receiver not supporting the
higher limit shall handle the first 10 APNs and shall ignore the load
information for the remaining APNs.

  NOTE 3:  The limit of the number of APN's takes into account various
         aspects such as: the processing and storage requirements at the
         overloaded node and the receiver, the number of important APNs for
         which load control advertisement will be necessary and
         interoperability between the nodes.

When including load control information for some APN(s), the PGW shall also
provide node level load control information by providing one instance of
the Load Control Information without the List-of-APN_and_Relative Capacity
parameter.

A node selecting a PGW for a given APN shall apply the APN level load
information, if available for that APN. If this parameter is not received
for a given APN but it has been received for other APN(s) from the same
PGW, then for this given APN, the node performing PGW selection shall
calculate the load metric, as described in 3GPP TS 29.303 [32], for the
target PGW.


12.2.5.1.3  Handling of parameters

If the PLMN supports the Load Control feature (see subclause 12.2.6), the
support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within Load Control
Information, is summarized in table 12.2.5.1.3-1.

|NOTE 3:  If this parameter is received, the receiver supporting the APN load|
|control feature shall handle and process APN load control information.      |



12.2.5.2 Frequency of inclusion

How often the sender includes the load control information is
implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load
control information is propagated to the target receivers within an
acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information (i.e. effective
load balancing) is achieved. The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as
follows:

  -  the sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only
    when the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;

  -  the sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every
    message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;

  -  the sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e.
    include the information during a first period then cease to do so
    during a second period.

The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control
Information only in a subset of the applicable GTP-C messages.

The receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in
any of the GTP-C messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception,
shall be able act upon the received load control information.


12.2.5.3 Limit on maximum number of instances

A GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the LCI IE, with
each providing load control information for a different scope. In order to
limit the processing of the message on the receiver side and the size of
the message on transport level, the number of load control information
instances shall be limited:

  -  at message level: there shall be at most one instance of node level
    LCI IE per node (i.e. per SGW or PGW) and at most 10 APN level
    instances.

  -  at node level: the maximum number of instances of LCI IE which may be
    provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same as
    the maximum number of instances of LCI IE at message level.


12.2.6 Discovery of the support of the feature by the peer node

A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to use the load control feature
(i.e. provide or handle load control information)

  -  within the PLMN, based on the operator's policy (local PLMN-wide
    configuration);

  -  across the PLMN boundaries, based on the operator's policy (local
    configuration per PLMN).

NOTE:  The feature may be activated when all or some of the nodes in the
       PLMN support the feature. The GTP-C entity assumes that all of the
       peer nodes support this feature when the feature is activated, i.e.
       it does not need to determine which peers support the feature.

The above operator policy/local configuration may allow the use of load
control at node level, load control at node level and APN level, or none.


12.2.7 Issues in the network with partial support of the feature

The Load Control feature should be supported homogenously across all the
SGWs and PGWs in the network. Not supporting this feature homogeneously
across the SGWs and PGWs may result in poor load balancing in the network
such that the SGWs or PGWs not supporting the feature may operate near
their maximum capacity (thus being more vulnerable to overload conditions)
while SGWs or PGWs supporting the feature have free capacity.

The Load Control feature should be supported homogenously across all the
MMEs, S4-SGSNs, ePDGs and TWANs. However, use of the feature when not all
of these nodes support the feature may not necessarily create a problem
since the load may remain fairly balanced across the SGWs and PGWs assuming
that the network imbalance caused by the non-supporting node may get
rectified by the supporting nodes making use of dynamic load information
while selecting the SGWs and PGWs.


12.3 Overload control solution


12.3.1 Principles of overload control

The stage 2 requirements on GTP-C overload control are defined in clause
4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 5.3.6.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060
[35]. The high level principles are summarized below:

  a) Overload control is an optional feature;

  b) a GTP-C entity may signal its overload to its GTP-C peers by including
    Overload Control Information in GTP-C signalling which provides
    guidance to the receiving GTP-C entity to decide actions which lead to
    signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information;

  c) the Overload Control Information may provide the overload information
    of a GTP-C entity, e.g. a PGW, or a specific APN(s) associated with the
    GTP-C entity;

  d) an MME/S4-SGSN may signal an overload to the PGW, via the SGW. An SGW
    may signal an overload to the MME/S4-SGSN and to the PGW. A PGW may
    signal an overload to the MME/S4-SGSN, via the SGW. For non-3GPP access
    based interfaces, a PGW may signal an overload to the ePDG and the
    TWAN; the ePDG and the TWAN may signal an overload to the PGW.

  NOTE 1:  An MME/S4-SGSN will not signal an overload to the SGW (i.e. the
         SGW will not perform overload control towards the MME/S4-SGSN), as
         this is redundant with DDN throttling (see subclause 12.3.3).

  e) the overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential
    treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services;

  f) the Overload Control Information is piggybacked in GTP control plane
    request or response messages such that the exchange of the Overload
    Control Information does not trigger extra signalling;

  NOTE 2:  The inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing
         messages means that the frequency increases as the signalling load
         increases, thus allowing faster feedback and better regulation.

  g) the computation and transfer of the Overload Control Information shall
    not add significant additional load to the GTP-C entity itself and to
    its corresponding peer GTP-C entities. The calculation of Overload
    Control Information should not severely impact the resource utilization
    of the GTP-C entity, especially considering the overload situation;

  h) clause 4.3.7.1a.2 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and clause 4.5 of 3GPP TS
    23.402 [45] provides examples of various potential overload mitigation
    actions based on the reception of the overload related information
    exchanged between GTP-C entities, for 3GPP access based interfaces and
    non-3GPP access based interfaces, respectively. However, the exact
    internal processing logics of a GTP-C entity will not be standardized;

  i) for the inter-PLMN case, local configuration may restrict the exchange
    and use of Overload Control Information across PLMNs;

  j) the GTP-C entity may decide to send different values of Overload
    Control Information on inter-network (roaming) and on intra-network
    (non-roaming) interfaces based on local configuration, i.e. the values
    sent on intra-network interfaces may differ from the values sent on
    inter-network interfaces. However, on intra-network interfaces, the GTP-

  NOTE:  Refer to Annex D.2 for information on the GTP-C interfaces for
         which Overload Control is not supported.


12.3.3 Node level overload control

Node level overload control refers to advertising of the overload
information at node level, i.e. overload information at node level
granularity, and applying the mitigation policies towards the target node
based on this information. This helps in preventing severe overload and
hence potential breakdown of the GTP-C node.

When a GTP-C entity determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic
is growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, it may signal
an Overload Control Information IE to instruct its GTP-C peers to reduce
the offered load accordingly.

Overload Control is performed independently for each direction between two
GTP-C entities. Overload Control may run concurrently, but independently,
for each direction between the two GTP-C entities.

Overload control of SGW originated traffic towards the MME/S4-SGSN shall
rely on Downlink Data Notification throttling, as specified in subclause
4.3.7.4.1a of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3] and 5.3.6.5 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [35], with
the addition that the SGWs should be allowed, by configuration, to throttle
DDN requests for low priority, as well as normal priority traffic (the SGW
shall then throttle by priority DDN requests for low priority traffic).


12.3.4 APN level overload control


12.3.4.1 General

APN level overload control refers to advertising of the overload
information at APN level granularity and hence applying the mitigation
policies based on this information to the signalling traffic related to
this APN only. Only a PGW may advertise APN level overload information when
it detects overload for certain APNs, e.g. based on shortage of internal or
external resources for an APN (e.g. IP address pool).

  NOTE:  When all the internal and external resources, applicable to the
         APNs, are available for all the APNs served by a PGW, the node
         level overload information is exactly the same as APN level
         overload information of that PGW, for each of its APNs, and hence,
         performing node overload control can be sufficient.


12.3.4.2 Elements of APN overload control

For allowing the effective APN overload control, at least the following
information (in addition to the other applicable information for overload
control as defined in clause 12.3.5.1.2) are required to be advertised by
the source node, as part of the APN level overload information:

APN: The APN for which the source node wants to advertise the overload
information;

APN-Overload-Reduction-Metric: It indicates the requested overload
reduction for the signalling traffic corresponding to a particular APN, as
a percentage. Its computation is implementation dependent and it has the
same characteristics as the "Overload-Reduction-Metric", described in
clause12.3.5.1.2.1, when applied at APN level.


12.3.5 Overload Control Information


12.3.5.1 Definition


12.3.5.1.1  General description

Within a message, one or multiple instances of the Overload Control
Information (OCI) IE may be included by the same GTP-C entity. Each
instance shall provide information about the overload condition to allow
the receiver to apply mitigation actions which will result in an efficient
alleviation of the overload condition at the sender.

The GTP-C entity shall always include the full set of overload control
information, i.e. all the node level and/or APN level applicable instances
of the OCI IE, when signalling overload control information in a message
for the first time or subsequently towards the receiver, even when only a
subset of the overload control information has changed. All the instances
of the OCI IE provided by a given GTP-C entity in a message shall contain
the same Overload Control Sequence Number. The Overload Control Sequence
Number shall be incremented whenever the overload control information is
modified (see subclause 12.3.5.1.2.1).

When including overload control information for some APN(s), the PGW should
not provide any node level Overload Control Information unless the node
level information is also applicable.

The receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a
peer with the newly received overload control information (received via one
or multiple instances of OCI IE) from the same GTP-C peer entity, if the
new information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the
Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored 'X'
instances of the OCI IE for a peer GTP-C entity, it shall overwrite those
'X' instances with the new set of 'Y' instances received in a message from
the same GTP-C peer entity, where X, Y are any integer numbers.

The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same
instance of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload
mitigation action. When more than one instance of the OCI IE is included,
the receiver shall consider the parameters included in each instance
independently, while applying the overload mitigation action.

The parameters are further described in subclauses 12.3.5.1.2 and
12.3.5.1.3.

Overload control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be
categorized as:

  -  Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is
    not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and
    correctly comprehend the Overload Control Information instance,
    containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other
    parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameters.

  -  Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is
    critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the
    Overload Control Information containing one or more of these
    parameters.

The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameter(s)
within any instance of Overload Control Information, without having the
knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the
sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter(s) in any
instance of Overload Control Information towards a receiver, if the
corresponding receiver is known to support these parameter(s). The sender
may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration;
this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in the
future.

Each instance of the OCI shall be associated by default to the GTP-C entity
corresponding to the peer node's IP address of the PDN connection, over
which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the
"Sender F-TEID for control plane" IE, the "PGW S5/S8/ S2a/S2b F-TEID for
PMIP based interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface" IE or within
the "MME/S4-SGSN Identifier" IE.

Alternatively, the GW (i.e. SGW and PGW) nodes may send Overload Control
Information which is associated with the GW node's identity, i.e. the FQDN
or IP address of the GW node received from the HSS (for a PGW) or the DNS
(for an SGW or PGW), the identity determined during the GW selection. In
that case, the GW node shall provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE
included in the message belongs to the GW node's identity.


12.3.5.1.2  Parameters


12.3.5.1.2.1  Overload Control Sequence Number

The GTP-C protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same
contents as the original message (see clause 7.6). Due to GTP-C
retransmissions, the overload control information received by a GTP-C
entity at a given time may be less recent than the overload control
information already received from the same GTP-C entity. The Overload
Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control information
received from an overloaded GTP-C entity. The Overload Control Sequence
Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with
the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used to
differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by
the same GTP-C entity.

The Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when
supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the
Overload Control Information IE.

The GTP-C entity generating this information shall increment the Overload
Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE.
The Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise.
The GTP-C entity may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer
format, of the generation of the overload control information, to populate
the Overload Control Sequence Number.

When multiple instances of the OCI IE are provided in the same message by a
given GTP-C entity, each of the Overload Control Sequence Numbers shall
have the same value.

This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly
collate out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to GTP-C retransmissions. This
parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine
whether the newly received overload control information has changed
compared to the overload control information previously received from the
same GTP-C entity. If the newly received overload control information has
the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received
overload control information from the same GTP-C peer, then the receiver
may simply discard the newly received overload control information whilst
continuing to apply the overload abatement procedures, as per the previous
value.

  NOTE 1:  The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see
         12.3.5.1.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload
         control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number
         as the previously received overload control information. If the
         overload condition persists and the overloaded GTP-C entity needs
         to extend the duration during which the overload information
         applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload control
         information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number
         (even if the parameters within the overload control information
         have not changed).

  NOTE 2:  The GTP-C Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-
         order overload information as e.g. overload control information may
         be sent in both GTP-C requests and responses, using independent GTP-
         C sequence numbering.

If the receiving GTP-C entity already received and stored overload control
information, which is still valid, from the overloaded GTP-C entity, the
receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the
Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information
is larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated
with the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload
Control Sequence Number or restart of the GTP-C entity, the Overload
Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the
peer GTP-C entity, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive
(and process) an Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is
less than the previous value.


12.3.5.1.2.2  Period of Validity

The Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the
overload condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid
(unless overridden by subsequent new overload control information).

An overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE
is received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE
with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control
Sequence Number) is received from the same GTP-C entity (at which point the
newly received overload control information shall prevail). The timer
corresponding to the period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI
IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control
Sequence Number) is received. When this timer expires, the last received
overload control information shall be considered outdated and obsolete,
i.e. any associated overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.

The Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting
overload control).

The Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:

  -  it avoids the need for the overloaded GTP-C entity to include the
    Overload Control Information IE in every GTP-C messages it signals to
    its GTP-C peers when the overload state does not change; thus it
    minimizes the processing required at the overloaded GTP-C entity and
    its GTP-C peers upon sending/receiving GTP-C signalling;

  -  it allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the GTP-C
    peers having received an overload indication from the overloaded GTP-C
    entity, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these GTP-C
    entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also
    removes the need for the overloaded GTP-C entity to remember the list
    of GTP-C entities to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction
    metric and to which it would subsequently need to signal when the
    overload condition ceases, if the Period of Validity parameter was not
    defined.


12.3.5.1.2.3  Overload Reduction Metric

The Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100
(inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender
of the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An
Overload Reduction Metric of "0" always indicates that the GTP-C entity is
not in overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be
applied) for the indicated scope.

Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload
Control Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated
Overload Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every
small variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload
Reduction Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating
the overload situation. During the typical operating condition of the
sender, a larger variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more
units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new
Overload Reduction Metric Information and thus justifying the processing
requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.

  NOTE:  The range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not
         mandate the sender to collect its own overload information at every
         increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload
         Reduction Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various
         implementation specific criteria, such as the architecture, session
         and signalling capacity, the current load/overload situation and so
         on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with
         which its own overload control information is collected.

The computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an
implementation choice at the sending GTP-C entity.

The Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload
control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.

The inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occuring,
unless the Overload Reduction Metric is set to 0, which signals that the
overload condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a
message does not mean that the overload has abated.


12.3.5.1.2.4  List of APNs

The List of APNs IE indicates one or more APNs for which the Overload
Control Information is applicable. When present in the OCI IE, the scope of
the overload control information shall be the list of the indicated APNs
for the PGW that sends the overload control information. At most one
instance of the List of APNs IE shall be included within one Overload
Control Information instance.

  NOTE 1:  The maximum number of APNs in the List of APNs is set to 10.
         More than 10 occurrences of APN within one single instance of the
         List of APNs IE is treated as a protocol error by the receiver.

If the List of APNs IE has not been included, the scope of the Overload
Control Information shall be the entire GTP-C entity (unless restricted by
other parameters in the Overload Control Information IE).

The List of APNs parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload
control). The List of APNs may be present or absent in the Overload Control
Information IE (depending on the scope of the reported overload control
information).

  NOTE 2:  The instance number of both the node-level and APN-level
         overload control information is "0" and the instance number is
         therefore not used to indicate if the scope of the overload control
         information is on PGW node level or APN level.

This parameter may be provided by the PGW only and it shall be used by the
MME/S4-SGSN and the TWAN/ePDG only.

The maximum number of APNs, for which the PGW may advertise the Overload
Control Information, shall be limited to 10, i.e. the maximum number of
occurrences of APNs within and across various instances of the Overload
Control Information IE shall be limited to 10 for a given PGW. Hence, if
the PGW supports more than 10 APNs, it shall advertise the overload control
for at most 10 of the most important APNs. In future, if needed, this limit
may be increased to allow the PGW to advertise the overload information for
more APNs. In that case, the receiver that does not support the higher
limit shall only handle the first 10 APNs and ignore the overload
information for the remaining APNs to enable future compatibility.

  NOTE 3:  Considering various aspects such as: the processing and storage
         requirements at the overloaded GTP-C entity and the receiver, the
         number of important APNs for which overload control advertisement
         could be necessary, interoperability between the nodes of various
         vendors, etc. it was decided to define a limit on maximum number of
         APNs for advertising the overload control information. It was
         decided to fix this limit to 10 whilst also ensuring that the
         mechanism exists to extend this limit in future releases, if
         required.


12.3.5.1.3  Handling of parameters

If the PLMN supports the Overload Control feature (see subclause 12.3.11),
the support, inclusion and handling of the parameters, within overload
control information, is summarized in table 12.3.5.1.3-1.

|process APN level overload control information.                             |



12.3.5.2 Frequency of inclusion

How often or when the sender includes the overload control information is
implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload
control information is propagated to the target receivers with an
acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the
effective overload control protection) is achieved. The following are some
of the potential approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI
IE:

  - the sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the
    new/changed value has not already been provided to the given receiver;

  - the sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards
    the receiver;

  - the sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the
    information during a first period then cease to do so during a second
    period.

The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a
subset of the applicable GTP-C messages.

The receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information
received in any of the GTP-C messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such
reception, shall be able act upon the received information.


12.3.5.3 Limit on maximum number of instances

A GTP-C entity may signal one or multiple instances of the OCI IE, each
instance providing overload control information for a different scope. The
receiver shall handle all these instances, from each of the peer GTP-C
entities, by processing, storing and acting upon the same foroverload
control. In order to limit the processing of the message on the receiver
side and the size of the message, the number of overload control
information instances shall be limited:

  -  at message level: there shall be at most one instance of node-level
    Overload Control Information IE per node and at most 10 APN-level
    instances.

  -  at node level: the maximum number of instances of the OCI IE which may
    be provided across multiple messages by a given node shall be the same
    as the maximum number of instances of the OCI IE at message level.


12.3.6 Propagating the MME/S4-SGSN identity to the PGW

When the Overload Control feature is supported by the MME/S4-SGSN and the
SGW, and it is also activated for the PLMN to which the PGW belongs (see
subclause 12.3.11), the following shall apply:

  -   The MME/S4-SGSN shall include the MME/S4-SGSN identity towards the
    SGW during:

    -  the PDN connection establishment, any mobility with an MME/S4-SGSN
       change or any SGW change procedures;

    -  the dedicated bearer activation procedure, PGW initiated bearer
       modification procedure and PGW initiated bearer deactivation
       procedure as per the conditions specified in the corresponding
       messages.

  - The SGW shall forward the MME/S4-SGSN identifier to the PGW if it is
    received in the Create/Update/Delete Bearer Response messages. When it
    is received in other GTP-C messages, the SGW shall store the received
    MME/S4-SGSN identity and shall include the currently serving MME/S4-
    SGSN's identity in subsequent Modify Bearer Request messages which are
    sent over the S5/S8 interface, whenever there is signalling over the
    S5/S8 interface.

  NOTE:  This allows updating of the PGW with the identity of the new
         MME/S4-SGSN during inter-MME/SGSN mobility scenarios as early as
         possible and without generating extra signalling over the S5/S8
         interface. Inter-MME/inter-SGSN intra SGW mobility scenarios not
         requiring to send any S5/S8 signalling could result in the PGW not
         being updated with the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN's identity,
         for a given subscriber, until subsequent S5/S8 signalling takes
         place for the same PDN connection. However, considering these
         scenarios are not so frequent and considering that several features
         anyway require S5/S8 signalling during these scenarios (e.g. for
         user location reporting), the PGW will most often get the identity
         of the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN. Hence the risk that the PGW
         wrongly throttles PGW initiated signalling for that PDN connection,
         if the old MME/S4-SGSN is in overload, is low.

  - The PGW shall store the currently serving MME/S4-SGSN identity,
    received from the SGW, to be able to reduce the PGW initiated
    signalling messages for the PDN connections during an overload
    situation at the serving MME/S4-SGSN.


12.3.7 Updating the PGW with overload control information of the target
         MME/S4-SGSN

During inter-MME/S4-SGSN mobility without SGW change scenarios, the SGW
shall forward the MME/S4-SGSN's overload control information over the S5/S8
interface only if the Modify Bearer Request message needs to be sent over
the S5/S8 for another reason, e.g. if the ULI, CGI, Serving Network,  needs
to be reported to the PGW, i.e. the SGW shall not generate a Modify Bearer
Request message over the S5/S8 interface for the sole purpose of reporting
the MME/S4-SGSN's overload control information. This avoids generating
extra signalling over the S5/S8 interface.

  NOTE:  If the MME/S4-SGSN provides overload control information during
         the scenarios which do not result in S5/S8 signaling, e.g. during
         an inter MME/S4-SGSN and intra SGW mobility, when no other
         information such as: the ULI, CGI or Serving Network, needs to be
         reported to the PGW, the overload information will not be relayed
         on to the PGW. Hence, the MME/S4-SGSN needs consider this when
         including overload control information.


12.3.8 The interaction with APN congestion control using the PGW Back-Off
         Time

When detecting that a given APN is congested, the PGW shall either use the
PGW Back-Off Time mechanism (see subclause 4.3.7.5 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [3])
or the APN level overload control mechanism (i.e. providing an Overload
Control Information IE with an APN-List included) for that APN, but not
both together for the same APN, e.g. if the PGW provides an Overload
Control Information IE with an APN-List set to "APN1", it shall not reject
Create Session Request messages for "APN1" with a PGW Back-Off Time until
the Period-Of-Validity of the overload information previously sent has
expired.

The PGW may however use both mechanisms concurrently for different APNs,
e.g. the PGW may reject Create Session Request messages for the"APN2" with
a PGW Back-Off Time IE, if the APN2 is also congested and if there is no on-
going APN-level overload control mechanism for that APN.

When rejecting a Create Session Request due to APN congestion, the PGW
shall set the "APN Congestion" cause, regardless of the aforementioned
mechanisms.

If the MME/S4-SGSN or ePDG/TWAN has one mechanism active for a given APN
and PGW, (e.g. an MME has received a PGW Back-Off Time) and if subsequently
it receives information for the same APN and PGW for another mechanism,
(e.g. the MME receives an Overload Control Info IE with APN-List included
for the same APN), then it shall deactivate/stop the earlier mechanism and
consider only the information received for the latter mechanism.

Different PGWs may use concurrently different mechanisms for the same APN.


12.3.9 Message throttling


12.3.9.1 General

As part of the overload mitigation, a GTP-C entity shall reduce the total
number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the
overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload
Control Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the
messages in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is
called message throttling.

Message throttling shall only apply to initial messages. Triggered request
or response messages should not be throttled since that would result in the
retransmission of the corresponding request message by the sender.

Before piggybacking the initial message over a response message, the
initial message should be subject to the message throttling in the similar
manner as any other non-piggybacked initial message. If the node decides to
throttle this initial message then the response message should be sent
without any piggyback message.

A GTP-C entity supporting GTP-C overload control shall support and use the
"Loss" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.


12.3.9.2 Throttling algorithm – "Loss"


12.3.9.2.1  Description

An overloaded GTP-C entity shall ask its peers to reduce the number of
requests they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control
Information including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage,
within the "Overload-Reduction-Metric", as specified in clause
12.3.5.1.2.1.

The recipients of the "Overload-Reduction-Metric" shall reduce the number
of requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an
alternate destination if possible (e.g. the Create Session Request message
may be redirected to an alternate SGW/PGW), or by failing the request and
treating it as if it was rejected by the destination GTP-C entity.

For example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is
sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would
have otherwise been sent to this GTP-C entity.

The overloaded GTP-C entity should periodically adjust the requested
traffic reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is
currently in use, the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level)
and the desired system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the
rate of the current overall received traffic.

Annex D.3.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation
of the "Loss" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.

  NOTE 1:  This algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic
         towards the overloaded GTP-C entity will be less than the past
         traffic but it ensures that the total traffic sent towards the
         overloaded GTP-C entity is less than what would have been sent
         without any throttling in place. If after requesting a certain
         reduction in traffic, the overloaded GTP-C entity receives more
         traffic than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the
         worsening rather than an improvement in the overload level, then
         the overloaded GTP-C entity can request for more reduction in
         traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the requested traffic
         reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives,
         approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.

  NOTE 2:  Since the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an
         absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput
         towards the overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the
         source nodes (depending upon the events generated towards these
         source nodes by other entities in the network), as a potential
         increase of traffic from some source nodes can possibly be
         compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from other source
         nodes.


12.3.9.3 Message prioritization


12.3.9.3.1  Description

When performing message throttling:

  -  GTP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in
    3GPP TS 22.153 [62]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending
    on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these
    GTP requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic
    reduction, and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling
    due to GTP overload control up to the point where the requested traffic
    reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;

  -  for other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the
    relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are
    considered as low priority are considered for throttling before the
    other messages. The relative priority of the messages may be derived
    from the relative priority of the procedure for which the message is
    being sent (as specified in subclause 12.3.9.3.2) or may be derived
    from the session parameters (as specified in subclause 12.3.9.3.3).

  NOTE:  A random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages
         without any special consideration, could result in an overall poor
         congestion mitigation mechanism and bad user experience.

An overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when
handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part
of the self-protection mechanism (see subclause 12.3.10.2.3).


12.3.9.3.2  Based on procedures

Message prioritization may be performed based on the relative priority of
the procedure for which the message is being sent. Procedures are grouped
into various categories and each of these categories is assigned a
priority. Additionally, within a given category of procedures, messages may
be further prioritized based on session parameters such as: APN, QCI, ARP
and/or LAPI (as described in subclause 12.3.9.3.3).

Subsequently, messages with a high priority shall be given lower preference
to throttle and messages with low priority shall be given higher preference
to throttle.

The grouping of the procedures is not performed based on an individual GTP-
C entity but whilst considering all the procedures in general. A GTP-C
entity should consider the procedures applicable to it and apply
prioritized message throttling based on the category of the procedure, as
described below. The categories are listed in decreasing order of priority
with category 1 having the highest priority. For each category a non-
exhaustive list of messages is provided. Any existing or newly defined
message in future should be considered based on the category (as specified
below) of the procedure for which the message is sent.

  1. UE session mobility within and across 3GPP or non-3GPP access:
    Procedures involving active or idle mode UE mobility, such that GTP-C
    signalling is involved, shall be classified under this category. Some
    examples are X2/S1 based handover with/without an SGW change, TAU/RAU
    with a change of MME/SGSN with/without an SGW change, 3GPP access to
    trusted non-3GPP access handover, etc. Throttling of these messages,
    during the procedures related to UE session mobility, would result in
    the failure of the corresponding procedures. This could result
    potentially in the loss of the PDN connection and/or the interruption
    of the services. Hence, the messages, as identified below, when sent
    during the procedures belonging to this category, shall be considered
    with the highest priority and hence, shall be given the lowest
    preference to throttle.

    -  Create Session Request,

    -  Create Session Request with "handover" indication bit set,

    -  Modify Bearer Request,

    -  Modify Bearer Request with "handover" indication bit set,

    -  Modify Access Bearer Request.

  2. Release of PDN connection or bearer resources: Procedures resulting in
    the deactivation of an existing PDN connection, the deactivation of
    bearer(s) or of data forwarding tunnel of an UE leads to freeing up of
    the resources at the overloaded node and hence, can potentially ease
    the overload situation, since the freed up resources can be used for
    serving the remaining of the UEs. Thus, the messages belonging to this
    category resulting in the deactivation of PDN connection or bearer(s)
    or data forwarding tunnel(s), as identified below, shall be treated
    with the next lower level of priority and hence shall be given the
    corresponding preference whilst throttling:

    -  Delete Session Request,

    -  Delete Bearer Request,

    -  Delete Bearer Command,

    -  Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.

  3. Miscellaneous session management procedures: This category shall
    consist of the session management procedures, except PDN connection
    creation and bearer creation/modification procedures. Some examples are
    location reporting, when it is not combined with other mobility
    procedures, Service request and S1 release procedure. These procedures
    do not severely impact the on-going service of the UE. Hence, the
    messages, as identified below, when sent during the procedures
    identified under this category, shall be treated with the next lower
    level of priority and hence, shall be given the corresponding
    preference whilst throttling:

    -  Release Access Bearer Request,

    -  Modify Bearer Request,

    -  Change Notification,

    -  Suspend Notification,

    -  Resume Notification.

  4. Request for new PDN Connection or bearer resources: Procedures
    requesting the creation of PDN connection, creation or modification of
    bearer(s) or creation of data forwarding tunnel shall be classified in
    this category. Throttling of the messages belonging to this category
    would result in denial of new services while continuing with the
    existing services. However, this is the natural outcome of an overload
    condition, i.e. the overloaded node, due to lack of resources, is not
    able to provision new services while the trying to maintain the
    existing services and hence, the messages, as identified below, when
    sent during the procedures belonging to this category, shall be
    considered with the lowest level of priority and hence shall be given
    highest preference to throttle:

    -  Create Session Request during PDN connection request,

    -  Create Bearer Request,

    -  Update Bearer Request,

    -  Bearer Resource Command,

    -  Modify Bearer Command,

    -  Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request.


12.3.9.3.3  Based on session parameters

Message prioritization may be performed based on the session parameters,
such as: APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator (LAPI). The
procedures and messages associated with the higher priority sessions shall
be given lesser preference whilst throttling, as compared to the procedures
and messages associated with the lower priority sessions. Within each group
of sessions, the messages may be further prioritized based on the category
of the procedure for which the message is being sent (as described in
subclause 12.3.9.3.2).

  NOTE:  This type of prioritization scheme ensures a good handling of all
         the messages and procedures related to higher priority sessions but
         can lead to throttle messages related to a critical procedure, e.g.
         UE mobility, for lower priority sessions over messages related to
         less critical procedures, e.g. location reporting, for a higher
         priority session.


12.3.9.3.4  Based on the Message Priority signalled in the GTP-C message

Message prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when
handling incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the
relative GTP-C message priority signalled in the GTP-C header (see
subclauses 5.4 and 5.5).

A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority
in GTP-C signalling within the PLMN and/or across the PLMN boundaries,
based on operator policy and roaming agreements. The following requirements
shall apply if being used.

A sending GTP-C entity shall determine the relative message priority to
signal in the message according to the principles specified in subclause
12.3.9.3.1. If the message affects multiple bearers (e.g. Modify Bearer
Request), the relative message priority should be determined considering
the highest priority ARP among all the bearers.

A GTP-C entity should set the same message priority in a Triggered message
or Triggered Reply message as received in the corresponding Initial message
or Triggered message respectively.

The message priority values sent on intra-network interfaces may differ
from the values sent on inter-network interfaces. When messages cross PLMN
boundaries, the Message Priority in the GTP-C header may be stripped or
modified in these messages.

  NOTE : This is to take into account that the priority definitions can
         vary between PLMNs and avoid messages from a foreign PLMN to gain
         unwarranted preferential treatment.

For incoming GTP-C messages that do not have a message priority in the GTP-
C header, the receiving GTP-C entity:

  -  shall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is an Initial
    message;

  -  should apply the message priority sent in the Initial message or
    Triggered message, if the incoming message is a Triggered or Triggered
    Reply message (respectively).

This feature should be supported homogenously across the nodes in the
network, otherwise an overloaded node will process initial messages
received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default priority
while initial messages received from supporting nodes will be processed
according to the message priority signalled in the GTP-C message.


12.3.10  Enforcement of overload control


12.3.10.1   General

When a GTP-C entity receives Overload Control Information from its peer, it
shall apply the overload abatement algorithm, based on the received
information, for the messages sent towards the peer GTP-C entity. This is
called "enforcement of overload control" and it involves throttling of the
messages targeted for the overloaded peer.


12.3.10.2   Aspects related to enforcement of the overload control


12.3.10.2.1 Good throughput of the network

A source GTP-C entity should avoid any mechanism resulting in over
throttling of the messages. Enforcement of the overload control whilst
ensuring that good throughput (i.e. measured in terms of the rate of total
number of messages the overloaded GTP-C entity can successfully process) of
the network remains consistent to that when no overload control is applied,
should be one of the prime objective of the source GTP-C entity.

  NOTE:  Over throttling of messages would negatively affect end user
         services and cause potential additional signalling in the network
         e.g. if the corresponding procedure is retried at a later time.


12.3.10.2.2 Message processing efficiency at the source GTP-C entity

Enforcement of overload control requires extra logic and extra processing
at the source GTP-C entity. This is an overhead since the source GTP-C
entity has to spend its resources in an activity other than processing of
the messages. Hence, the implementation as well as the processing
complexity of the enforcement of the overload control, should not result in
a significantly poorer efficiency of the source GTP-C entity.


12.3.10.2.3 Self-protection by the overloaded GTP-C entity

A source GTP-C entity enforcing the overload control cannot ensure that the
overloaded peer will not receive more messages than what it can handle
during the overload condition, e.g. the "loss" algorithm does not guarantee
that the future traffic reaches perfectly that requested by the overloaded
GTP-C entity. Hence, the overloaded target GTP-C entity shall protect
itself from the risk of meltdown even in a network where all the sending
GTP-C entities support the overload control mechanism. As a part of this
self-protection, the overloaded target GTP-C entity may reject the messages
which it cannot handle during an overloaded state. A GTP-C entity which
decides to not process an incoming request message due to overload should
still send a reject response message, if possible, indicating the temporary
unavailability of the resources; otherwise the request message may be
dropped.

  NOTE:  Without a response message, the source GTP-C entity cannot
         determine whether the request did not reach the target GTP-C entity
         due to a network error or whether the target GTP-C entity was in
         overload and not able to process the request and send a response
         message. This will cause the source GTP-C entity to retransmit the
         request message and hence will increase further the overload at the
         target node.

The GTP-C entity may apply message prioritization as described in subclause
12.3.9.3 when selecting the incoming request messages to be throttled.

While rejecting the message due to overload, the GTP-C entity shall set the
cause to "GTP-C Entity Congestion" or "APN congestion" (for node level or
APN level overload respectively) and may include the Overload Control
Information in the rejection response as specified in subclauses 12.3.5.1.1
and 12.3.11.


12.3.10.3   Enforcement of overload control between GTP-C entities in
           direct contact

A source GTP-C entity shall enforce overload control for traffic destined
to a GTP-C entity in direct contact based on the overload reduction metric
received from that peer, e.g. the MME applies the overload control for the
messages targeted for the SGW based on the overload information of the SGW.



12.3.10.4   Enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities


12.3.10.4.1 Description

For messages destined to a remote GTP-C entity (i.e. a GTP-C entity not in
direct contact but reached via an intermediate GTP-C entity), the source
GTP-C entity shall enforce the overload control based on the overload
information of the target of the message, as well as the overload
information of the intermediate GTP-C entity, e.g. the MME applies the
overload control for messages targeted for the PGW based on the overload
information of the SGW and PGW.

For the received messages, the intermediate GTP-C entity shall not further
enforce any overload control and hence, shall not reject any message
towards the source GTP-C entity.

Annex D.4.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation.

  NOTE 1:  This approach ensures the overload protection of the Target as
         well as Intermediate GTP-C entities.

  NOTE 2:  The source GTP-C entity may be connected to the same Target GTP-
         C entity via multiple different Intermediate GTP-C entities. The
         exact algorithm used at the source GTP-C entity to enforce the
         overload control, as per the aforementioned requirements, is
         implementation specific.


12.3.11  Discovery of the support of the feature by the peer node

A GTP-C entity shall determine whether to use the overload control feature:


  -  within the PLMN, based on operator's policy (local PLMN-wide
    configuration);

  -  across the PLMN boundaries, based on operator's policy (local
    configuration per PLMN).

NOTE:  The feature can be activated when all or some of the nodes in the
       PLMN support the feature. The GTP-C entity assumes that all the peer
       nodes support this feature when the feature is activated, i.e. it
       does not need to determine which peers support the feature.

The above operator policy/local configuration may allow the use of overload
control at node level and APN level, or none.


12.3.12  Issues in the network with partial support of the feature

The Overload Control feature should be supported homogenously across the
nodes in the network, otherwise:

  -  an overloaded node will get messages beyond its acceptable processing
    capacity, even after announcing its overload status. This may result in
    severe overload and possibly a breakdown of the node;

  -  a non-supporting node will get an unfair advantage in sending all the
    messages to an overloaded node, whereas a supporting node, would be
    requested to throttle more messages.


12.3.13  Implicit overload control mechanisms

Implicit overload control mechanisms are mechanisms used between GTP-C
entities when GTP-C overload control is not supported or not enabled
between them, e.g. across PLMN boundary based on operator's policy, to help
reducing the overload at the overloaded node:

  -  a GTP-C entity which decides to not process an incoming request
    message due to overload should still send a reject response message, if
    possible, indicating the temporary unavailability of the resources,
    e.g. No resources available; otherwise the GTP-C entity may drop the
    incoming request message.

  NOTE:  Without a response message, the source GTP-C entity cannot
         determine whether the request did not reach the target GTP-C entity
         due to a network error or whether the target GTP-C entity was in
         overload and not able to process the request and send a response
         message. This will cause the source GTP-C entity to retransmit the
         request message and hence will increase further the overload at the
         target node.

  -  a GTP-C entity in overload may support messages throttling as a self
    protection mechanism and may apply message prioritization as described
    in subclause 12.3.9.3 when selecting the incoming request messages to
    be throttled;

  -  based on the number and rate of reject responses indicating temporary
    unavailability of resources, e.g. No resources available,  a source GTP-
    C entity should try to assess the overload level of the target GTP-C
    entity and apply correspondingly message throttling as described in
    subclause 12.3.9 to reduce the amount of traffic sent towards the
    overloaded GTP-C entity.


13 Detection and handling of late arriving requests


13.1 General

The procedures specified in this clause aim at handling more efficiently
requests which may arrive late at upstreams entities, e.g. in networks
experiencing processing or transport delays.

These procedures are optional to support. When supported, the use of these
procedures is dependent on operator policy.

The procedure specified in subclause 13.2 may be used with or without the
procedure specified in subclause 13.3. The procedure specified in subclause
13.3 shall only be used in conjunction with the procedure specified in
subclause 13.2.


13.2 Detection and handling of requests which collide with an existing
         session context


13.2.1 General

This procedure enables an entity, which receives a request colliding with
an existing session context, to know the time at which the new request and
the existing session were originated, and to accept the new request only if
it is more recent than the existing session.

The originating entities within the PLMN (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN and ePDG)
shall be NTP synchronized.


13.2.2 Principles

The following principles shall apply if this procedure is supported and
enabled by operator policy.

A GTP-C entity originating a Create Session Request (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN
or ePDG) shall include in the message the Origination Time Stamp indicating
the absolute time at which the request is initiated.

The SGW shall forward this parameter over the S5/S8 interface, if it is
received from the MME/SGSN.

Upon receipt of a session establishment request which collides with an
existing session context, the PGW shall accept the new session
establishment request only if it contains a more recent time stamp than the
time stamp stored for the existing session. An incoming session request
shall be considered as more recent than an existing session and be accepted
if no Origination Time Stamp information was provided for at least one of
the two sessions. The PGW shall reject an incoming request whose time stamp
is less recent than the time stamp of the existing session with the cause
'Late Overlapping Request'.

3GPP TS 29.212 [29] and 3GPP TS 29.273 [68] further specify:

  -  the PGW requirements regarding the forwarding of the Origination Time
    Stamp parameter over the Gx and/or S6b interfaces, when received from
    the SGW or TWAN/ePDG;

  -  the handling of the Origination Time Stamp parameter by the PCRF and
    3GPP AAA Server for an incoming request colliding with an existing
    session context.

An originating entity which detects a NTP failure shall not include the
Origination Time Stamp towards other entities.


13.3 Detection and handling of requests which have timed out at the
         originating entity


13.3.1 General

This procedure enables an entity which receives a request to know when the
request times out at the originating entity, and to stop further
processing, at the receiver and further upstream entities, a request which
has timed out at the originating entity.

The originating entities (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN and ePDG) and the receiving
entities (i.e. SGW, PGW, PCRF, 3GPP AAA Server) shall be NTP synchronized.
This procedure may be used between entities pertaining to the same PLMN,
and if allowed by operator policy, between entities pertaining to different
PLMNs.

This procedure shall not affect the setting of the retransmission timers by
intermediate entities. E.g. the SGW shall set its T3 and N3 retransmission
parameters as specified in this specification, irrespective of the time at
which the request times out at the originating entity.


13.3.2 Principles

The following principles shall apply if this procedure is supported,
enabled by operator policy and if the PGW pertains to the same PLMN as the
originating entity or if the PGW pertains to a different PLMN and operator
policy in the originating entity allows to use this procedure towards this
PLMN.

A GTP-C entity originating a Create Session Request (i.e. MME, SGSN, TWAN
or ePDG) shall include in the message the Origination Time Stamp indicating
the absolute time at which the request is initiated, as specified in
subclause 13.2.2, and the Maximum Wait Time indicating the maximum time
period to complete the processing of the request. The Maximum Wait Time,
together with the Origination Time Stamp, indicates the absolute time at
which the request times out at the originating entity.

The MME/SGSN shall set the Maximum Wait Time to a value smaller or equal to
(N3+1) x T3 set in the SGW, to avoid upstream entities continuing to
process requests which would have ceased to be processed by the SGW, which
could result in hanging contexts in upstream entities.

  NOTE 1:  If the Maximum Wait Time is set to a value smaller than N3 x T3
         set in the SGW, the SGW actually stops retransmitting a given GTP-C
         Create Session Request as soon as it receives a rejection response
         from the PGW due to the expiry of the Maximum Wait Time. I.e. the
         Maximum Wait Time actually leads to shorten the duration during
         which the SGW retransmits the GTP-C request.

The SGW shall forward the Origination Time Stamp over the S5/S8 interface
as specified in subclause 13.2.2. The SGW shall also forward the Maximum
Wait Time over the S5/S8 interface, if received from the MME/SGSN.

Upon receipt of a request which contains the Origination Time Stamp and the
Maximum Wait Time parameters, the receiving entity should check that the
request has not already timed out at the originating entity. The receiving
entity may perform additional similar checks during the processing of the
request, e.g. upon receipt of a response from the next upstream entity.

The receiving entity should reject a request that is known to have timed
out with the cause 'Timed Out Request'; it may alternatively drop the
request. Besides, the receiving entity should initiate the release of any
session it may have successfully created towards an upstream entity, to
avoid hanging sessions in the network.

  NOTE 2:  Sending a rejection response over the last hop towards the
         originating node, i.e. over S11/S4 or S2a/S2b, is not useful as the
         request has timed out at the originated entity.

In the context of this specification, the receiving entity refers to an SGW
or PGW.

3GPP TS 29.212 [29] and 3GPP TS 29.273 [68] further specify:

  -  the PGW requirements regarding the forwarding of the Maximum Wait Time
    parameter over the Gx and/or S6b interfaces, when received from the SGW
    or TWAN/ePDG;

  -  the handling of the Maximum Wait Time parameter by the PCRF and 3GPP
    AAA Server.

An originating entity which detects a NTP failure shall not insert the
Origination Time Stamp and the Maximum Wait Time parameters towards other
entities. A receiving entity which detects a NTP failure shall ignore the
the Maximum Wait Time parameter.


14 Handling of Bearer Contexts Mismatch


14.1 General

Bearer Contexts mismatch among different EPC entities, e.g. MME/SGW/PGW,
can happen due to various reasons, e.g. transport network delay, signalling
overload.


14.2 Detection of Bearer Context Mismatch

Bearer Context mismatch can be detected by a receiving GTP-C entity in the
following cases:

  -  when at least one dedicated bearer context in the request message is
    unknown; or

  -  when at least one dedicated bearer context is missing in the request
    message in comparison to the bearer contexts stored; or

  -  when receiving a response message indicating that one of the dedicated
    bearer context(s) was unknown, by using the cause code "Context not
    found" at the Bearer Context level. See also subclause 8.4.

The Modify Bearer Request/Response and the Modify Access Bearer
Request/Response in particular enables an easy detection of bearer contexts
mismatch since all the bearer contexts, either of the PDN connection for a
Modify Bearer Request/Response or of all the UE's PDN connections for a
Modify Access Bearer Request/Response, need to be included in the messages.



14.3 Handling of Bearer Context Mismatch


14.3.1 General

The following requirements should apply:

  1) When an EPC entity receives a response message, where one or more
    dedicated bearer context(s) is associated with the Cause code "Context
    Not Found" while the PDN connection is known by the peer, the EPC
    entity shall delete the corresponding bearer context(s);

  2) When an SGW receives a Modify Bearer Request, where one or more
    dedicated bearer context(s) is missing in the request message in
    comparison to the Bearer Context(s) stored for the UE's PDN connection,
    the SGW shall accept the Modify Bearer Request message and delete the
    corresponding bearer context(s) locally. The PGW shall apply the same
    behavior if the Modify Bearer Request received at the PGW includes the
    Bearer Contexts to be modified IE;

  3) When a SGW receives a Modify Bearer Request, where only one or more
    dedicated bearer context(s) is unknown, the SGW shall accept the Modify
    Bearer Request message partially and set the cause code "Context Not
    Found" for those unknown bearer context(s) at Bearer Context level. The
    PGW shall apply the same behavior if the Modify Bearer Request received
    at the PGW includes the Bearer Contexts to be modified IE;

  4) When a SGW receives a Modify Access Bearer Request, where one or more
    dedicated bearer context(s) is missing in the request message in
    comparison to the Bearer Context(s) stored for all the UE's PDN
    connections, the SGW shall delete the corresponding bearer context(s)
    locally;

  5) When a SGW receives a Modify Access Bearer Request, where only one or
    more dedicated bearer context(s) is unknown, the SGW shall accept the
    Modify Access Bearer Request message partially and set the cause code
    "Context Not Found" for those unknown bearer context(s) at Bearer
    Context level.

  NOTE:  It is assumed the PGW can at least use a subsequent Modify Bearer
         Request to resolve Bearer Context mismatch, so that the SGW need
         not send explicit message to delete unknown Bearer Context.


14.3.2 Exceptional scenarios

During a dedicated bearer creation procedure, temporary Bearer Context
mismatch may occur at the SGW, e.g. due to the collision between Create
Bearer Request and Modify (Access) Bearer Request messages. Applying the
general requirements of subclause 14.3.1 may in such case lead to
unnecessary signalling and cause extra latency. The SGW should handle such
Bearer Context mismatch in an implementation specific way, but in such a
way to accept the Modify (Access) Bearer Request message and to not locally
delete the missing Bearer Context.

During a Network Triggered Service Request procedure, which is triggered by
a dedicated bearer creation procedure towards a UE in Idle mode, the MME
shall include only the existing Bearer Contexts (not the new Bearer
Contexts just created) in the corresponding Modify (Access) Bearer Request
message. The same principle shall apply when piggybacking is used, i.e.
when the Modify Bearer Request is piggybacked in the Create Bearer Response
message, the MME shall include only the existing Bearer Contexts (not the
new Bearer Contexts just created) in the corresponding Modify (Access)
Bearer Request message.

  NOTE:  During a Network Triggered Service Request procedure, which is
         triggered by a dedicated bearer creation procedure towards a UE in
         Idle mode, bearer mismatches can be avoided by the MME sending the
         Create Bearer Response only after it receives the Modify Bearer
         Response message, however in some rare cases, the signalling can be
         delayed for the UE, e.g. if the Modify Bearer Response is lost.



Annex A (Informative):
Backward Compatibility Guidelines for Information Elements

In order to preserve backward compatibility, the following rules should
apply when adding or modifying information elements for existing messages.

  -  No new mandatory (M) information elements should be added.

  -  No new conditional (C) information elements should be added.

  -  Any new IEs should be either:

     optional (O), having no conditions on their presence, or

     conditional-optional (CO), having conditions that should apply only to
       the sender and not to the receiver.

     Such conditions should be worded generally as follows: "This IE shall
       be sent over the xxx interface <condition>. The receiving entity need
       not check the IE's presence."

  - If any new conditions are added to a previously specified conditional
    (C) information element, these new conditions should apply only to the
    sender and not to the receiver.

    Such additional conditions should be worded generally as follows: "This
    IE shall be sent over the xxx interface <condition>. For this optional
    condition, the receiving entity need not check the IE's presence."

    Existing conditions for such conditional (C) IEs should be treated as
    before, and the presence of the IEs should remain conditional (C).


Annex B (Informative):
Transparent copying of RANAP/S1AP IEs into GTP IEs


B.1    General

This annex provides details on how a GTPv2 entity transparently copies
information received from RANAP or S1AP into GTPv2 IE or IE field.

RANAP and S1AP ASN.1 encoding details in this annex are informative. The
reference specifications are 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10]
respectively.

The respective RANAP/S1AP Information Elements are transported on the Iu/S1
interface within a "protocol-IE container" which is composed of:

  -  an Information Element Identity (referred to below as "IE-ID"),

  -  an indication how the receiver shall react if the Information Element
    is not comprehended (referred to below as "criticality"),

  -  and an "open type field" which consists of a length indication ("OT-
    LI")  and the Information Element itself (referred to below as "IE").

RANAP/S1AP PDUs and the contained IEs are defined by means of ASN.1, the
specified encoding is PER (packed encoding rule), Octet aligned variant:

  -  PER minimises the information sent on the respective interface to the
    absolute minimum;

  -  Hence, type definitions of fixed length are encoded without any type
    or length indication, only type definitions of variable length contain
    a length indication, e.g.

    -  an OCTET STRING with indefinite length would need to contain a
       length indication (referred to below as "OCT-LI") followed by the
       actual octets (referred to below as "octets");

    -  a SEQUENCE neither contains a type, nor a length-indication. Only in
       case of optional elements it contains a kind of bit string with each
       position of this bitstring indicating the presence of an OPTIONAL
       element (an encoded SEQUENCE type is referred to below as
       "sequence").


B.2    Handover/Relocation related generic transparent Containers over
         RANAP, S1-AP and GTP

Handover/Relocation related generic transparent containers are defined in
3GPP TS 25.413 [33] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] ("Source to Target Transparent
Container" IE and "Target to Source Transparent Container" IE) to carry
UTRAN, E-UTRAN or GERAN specific information via CN interfaces in a RAT-
agnostic way.

The encoding of these handover/relocation related generic transparent
containers is different in RANAP and S1-AP. See 3GPP TS 36.413 [10] Annex
C. The difference is that the "Source to Target Transparent Container" IE
and "Target to Source Transparent Container" IE are ASN.1 encoded over
RANAP as "IE-ID||criticality||OT-LI||octets" (i.e. one length field only
for the open type field) and over S1AP as "IE-ID||criticality||OT-LI||OCT-
LI||octets" (i.e. with 2 length fields, one for the open type field ("OT-
LI"), one for the octet string encoding ("OCT-LI")), while "octets" contain
the actual RAT specific handover/relocation information.

This gives the following chain of encodings (represented in the notation
introduced in the Notes above) end-to-end.

LTE to LTE



                                    [pic]

    Figure B.2-1: LTE to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers

In the case of LTE-LTE handover, the "octets" contain the "Source eNB to
Target eNB Transparent Container" (defined as an ASN.1 SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS
36.413[10]).

The source MME, after decoding the HO REQUIRED message of S1AP, passes
transparently the "sequence" to the target MME.

The target MME encodes similarly at target side with the same definitions:
it feeds the received "sequence" into the S1AP ASN.1 encoder in order to
encode the HO REQUEST message towards the target eNB. The "sequence" is
then extracted from the S1AP ASN.1 of eNB and given to application part of
eNB.



LTE to 3G



                                    [pic]

    Figure B.2-2: LTE to 3G - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers

At source side, the same encoding is done but for LTE to 3G handover, this
time the "octets" on the line is the "Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container" (encoded according to the target system RANAP i.e. as an ASN.1
SEQUENCE in 3GPP TS 25.413 [33]).

Again the source MME passes transparently the "sequence" to the target MME
i.e. the "Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container".

At the target side, the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message was not upgraded:
the "sequence" received from the Gn or S3 interface ("Source RNC to Target
RNC Transparent Container") is not encoded as an OCTET STRING as on S1, but
directly represent the "Source To Target Transparent Container" within the
RANAP:RELOCATION REQUEST message, which in case of inter-RAT handover to 3G
represent the "Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container", transported
on the Iu interface as the "IE" part of the "IE container". There is no
additional length field added as on the S1 interface ("OCT-LI").

The target side remains therefore fully backwards compatible with UMTS
release 7.

3G to LTE



                                    [pic]

    Figure B.2-3: 3G to LTE - Encoding of Generic Transparent Containers

The RELOCATION REQUIRED message was upgraded from release 8 onwards
renaming the previously contained "Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container" to "Source to Target Transparent Container", being able to
transport also a "Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container".

Despite being defined as an octet string, in order to not impact the R7
SGSN, the octet string was specified as "to be replaced" by either the
UTRAN or E-UTRAN specific container. This fact is explained e.g. within the
NOTE in the ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 25.413 [33] ], as shown in this excerpt:

Source-ToTarget-TransparentContainer ::= OCTET STRING
-- This IE is a transparent container, the IE shall be encoded not as an
OCTET STRING but according to the type specifications of the target system.
-- Note: In the current version of this specification, this IE may either
carry the Source RNC to
-- Target RNC Transparent Container or the Source eNB to Target eNB
Transparent Container IE as
-- defined in [49]

By so doing, the Release 7 source SGSN receives only one length field (the
"OT-LI") instead of two (the "OT-LI and the "OCT-LI") as if it would
receive an "Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container" from a Release
7 RNC, ensuring fully Release 7 backwards compatibility as requested by
3GPP TS 23.401 [3] Annex D. This is illustrated in Figure B.1-3 above.

As explained above, this Release 7 backwards compatibility constraint only
applies to RANAP to cope with Release 7 SGSN nodes and does NOT apply to
LTE. This is why the note is NOT present in the ASN.1 of 3GPP TS 36.413
[10] for LTE i.e. the S1AP octet string does not need "to be replaced".

Then "sequence" is passed transparently to the target MME. The target MME
encodes the "sequence" within an OCTET STRING resulting in two length
fields as expected by target eNB ASN.1 S1AP decoder.


B.3    Other RANAP and S1-AP IEs

When transparently copying a RANAP/S1AP IE, other than the
handover/relocation related generic transparent containers (see Annex B.1)
into GTP IE, or GTP IE field the following applies:

  -  a transparent copy of a RANAP/S1AP IE, which is transported on the
    Iu/S1 interface within a "protocol-IE container", neither includes the
    Information Element Identity ("IE-ID") nor the "criticality" nor the
    open type field related length indication ("OT-LI"), but only the
    Information Element itself ("IE").

  -  "IE" refers to all parts of the encoded type of the Information
    Element, i.e. including also any related length indication (in case of
    types with variable length) and preamble (see ITU-T X.691 [49] for the
    definition of the term "preamble").


Annex C (Normative):
MME/S4-SGSN mapping table between S11/S4 and NAS Cause values

The MME/S4-SGSN initiates session management requests towards the SGW and
PGW or mobility management requests towards the source/target MME/S4-SGSN.
If this operation is not successful, there are several possible cause
codes, which need to be mapped to the appropriate cause codes over NAS to
the UE.

Additionally, the MME/S4-SGSN initiates session management requests towards
the UE. If this operation is not successful, there are several possible NAS
cause codes which need to be mapped to the appropriate GTP cause codes over
S11/S4 interface towards the SGW.

The MME/S4-SGSN should map these cause codes as defined in tables C.1 to
C.5 unless specified otherwise in the tables.

|NOTE 2:  The MME/S4-SGSN may for certain GTP cause codes trigger a new GTP  |
|procedure instead of rejecting the NAS request.                             |
|NOTE 3:  When multiple NAS Cause values are defined for a given GTP cause   |
|value, any of those NAS Cause values may be sent to the UE based on         |
|implementation choice.                                                      |


  NOTE:  The MME can send the EMM cause set to #15 "No suitable cells in
         tracking area" to the UE, if the PDN connectivity request is
         rejected due to the ESM cause #29, which is mapped from the GTPv2
         cause code #92 or XXX, based on operator policies.  See 3GPP TS
         24.301 [23]. This enables a roamer to get service in a VPLMN even
         when being rejected via LTE access due to e.g. no credit
         authorisation from the OCS.

Annex D (Informative):
GTP-C load and overload control mechanism


D.1    GTP-C interfaces not supporting Load Control

Load Control has been designed as a generic mechanism possibly applicable
to any GTP-C node. However, for the reasons clarified below, in the current
release, Load Control is not supported for the following GTP-C based
interfaces:

  -  S3, S10, S16 (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to minimize impact to
    the MME/S4-SGSN);

  -  Sm, Sn (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to avoid impact to the MBMS
    GW);

  -  Sv (limited GTP-C signalling traffic, to avoid impact to the legacy CS
    products);

  -  S101, S121 (to avoid impacts to the legacy HRPD products);

  -  Gn/Gp (to avoid impact to the legacy Gn-SGSN/GGSN products and GTPv1-C
    protocol).


D.2    GTP-C interfaces not supporting Overload Control

Overload Control has been designed as a generic mechanism possibly
applicable to any GTP-C based interface and any direction. However for the
reasons clarified below, in the current release, Overload Control is not
supported for the following GTP-C based interfaces:

  -  S3, S10, S16 (see considerations below, to minimize impact to MME and
    S4-SGSN);

    -  most of the S3 traffic would remain internal to the combo-node with
       the deployment of combo-MME/S4-SGSN nodes. The traffic over S10/S16
       is also reduced with the deployment of MME and SGSN pools. It is
       therefore not essential to throttle the traffic on these interfaces
       when an MME or S4-SGSN experiences overload;

    -  throttling signalling on these interfaces resulting from a user's
       mobility (inter-MME/S4-SGSN TAU, RAU and Handover) would result in
       bad end user's perception (handover failure, loss of PDN connections)
       and so needs to be avoided as far as possible;

    -  an MME or S4-SGSN in overload may drop locally incoming RIM messages
       without causing GTP-C retransmissions (although this may cause the
       RAN to retransmit the message).

  -  S11/S4 (from an MME/S4-SGSN to an SGW, with SGW as consumer; see
    consideration below);

    -  by allowing the SGW to throttle DDN requests for normal priority
       traffic, the overload control of the messages originated by the SGW
       towards the MME/S4-SGSN is covered and hence, an SGW performing
       overload control towards the MME/S4-SGSN using Overload Control
       Information would be redundant.

  -  S5/S8 (from a PGW to an SGW, with the SGW as a consumer; no signalling
    message, originated by the SGW towards the PGW, that is identified as
    requiring overload control);

  -  Sm, Sn (no overload scenario identified, limited GTP-C traffic, to
    avoid impact to the MBMS GW);

  -  Sv (no overload scenario identified, to avoid impact to the legacy CS
    products);

  -  S101, S121 (no overload scenario identified, to avoid impact to the
    legacy HRPD products);

  -  Gn/Gp (to avoid impact to the legacy Gn-SGSN/GGSN products and GTPv1-C
    protocol);


D.3  "Loss" throttling algorithm


D.3.1  Example of possible implementation

This subclause provides an example of a possible implementation of the
"Loss" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.

It is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random
selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to
decide if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For
example, the source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for
each message which is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10%
throttling, messages with a random number 10 or less are throttled and
hence this achieves approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic.
The actual traffic reduction might vary slightly from the requested
percentage, albeit by an insignificant amount.

The algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For
example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-
priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of
dropping the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in
traffic conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For
example, in the 50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority
messages, 20% reduction to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high
priority messages need to be applied in order to achieve the effective
reduction in traffic by 10% towards the overloaded node.


D.4    Enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities


D.4.1  Example of possible implementation

This subclause provides an example of a possible implementation of the
enforcement of overload control between remote GTP-C entities, amongst
other possible methods, considering the example network topology described
in Figure D.4.1-1.

                                    [pic]

                  Figure D.4.1-1: Example network topology

The source GTP-C entity can apply message throttling according to the
maximum of the overload reduction metric reported by the intermediate and
target GTP-C entities, i.e. max (Intermediate_Overload-Metric,
Target_Overload-Metric), for each of the path between the source and the
target GTP-C entities. Each path is considered independently whilst
performing the message throttling.

Considering the following example overload condition for the topology
above:

     Target_Overload-Metric = 30%

     IntermediateA_Overload-Metric = 10%

     IntermediateB_Overload-Metric = 20%

     IntermediateC_Overload-Metric = 40%

     Target_Terminated-Messages = 100

     IntermediateA-Target_Messages = 20

     IntermediateB-Target_Messages = 50

     IntermediateC-Target_Messages = 30

the source GTP-C entity applies message throttling as follows:

     Source-IntermediateA_Messages = 14 (message throttling of 30% applied)

     Source-IntermediateB_Messages = 35 (message throttling of 30% applied)

     Source-IntermediateC_Messages = 18 (message throttling of 40% applied)

     Source-Target_Messages = 67 (the Target GTP-C entity receives 67
    messages although it could have handled 70 messages in the overloaded
    condition).


Annex E (Normative):
TWAN mapping table between GTPv2 S2a Cause and non-3GPP access Cause values

The TWAN initiates session establishment requests or mobility management
requests towards the PGW. If this operation is not successful, there are
several possible cause codes, which need to be mapped to the appropriate
cause codes over non-3GPP access to the UE.

The TWAN should map these cause codes as defined in Table E.1, Table E.2,
Table E.3 and Table E.4.
