The 3GPP core network charging architecture and\nprinciples are specified in document TS 32.240\u00a0[1], which provides an\numbrella for other charging management documents that specify:\n\n  - the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);\n\n  - the content of real-time charging events per domain/subsystem (online\n    charging);\n\n  - the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and\n    subsystems;\n\n  - the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the\n    charging information\n    (i.e. CDRs or charging events).\n\nThe complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240\u00a0[1].\n\nThe present document specifies the CDR parameters, the abstract syntax and\nencoding rules for all the CDR types that are defined in the charging\nmanagement TSs described above. Therefore, it is only applicable to offline\ncharging. The mechanisms used to transfer the CDRs from the generating node\nto the operator's Billing Domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation\ndevice) are specified in TS 32.297\u00a0[52]. Further details with respect to\nthe operator's Billing Domain for offline charging are out of scope of 3GPP\nstandardisation.\n\nNote that a generic Diameter application for online charging in 3GPP\nnetworks is specified in TS 32.299\u00a0[50]. Furthermore, 3GPP TSs are being\ncreated to standardise some technical aspects of the operator's Billing\nDomain for online charging, i.e. the Online Charging System (OCS).\n\nAll terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that\nare common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR\n21.905\u00a0[100]. Those that are common across charging management in 3GPP\ndomains or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240\u00a0[1]\nand are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading.\nFinally, those items that are specific to the present document are defined\nexclusively in the present document.\n\nFurthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS\n22.115\u00a0[101].\n\n\n\n"}, {"key": "References", "numbering": "2", "title_level": 0, "desc": "         2  References\n\nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this\ntext, constitute provisions of the present document.\n\n  -  References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\n  edition number, version number, etc.) or non-specific.\n\n  -  For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.\n\n  -  For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

It\n    starts from 1 and is increased by 1 for each service date container\n    generated within the lifetime of this IP-CAN bearer/TDF session.\n\n  -  Time of First Usage is the time stamp for the first IP packet to be\n    transmitted and mapped to the current service data container. For\n    envelope reporting controlled by the Time Quota Mechanism, this\n    indicates the time stamp for the first IP packet to be transmitted that\n    causes an envelope to be opened \u2013 see TS 32.299 [50].\n\n  -  Time of Last Usage is the time stamp for the last IP packet to be\n    transmitted and mapped to the current service data container. For\n    envelope reporting, controlled by the Time Quota Mechanism, this\n    indicates the time stamp for an envelope to be closed \u2013 see TS 32.299\n    [50] for conditions for envelope closure.\n\n  -  Time Usage contains the effective used time within the service data\n    container recording interval.\n\n  -  Service Condition Change defines the reason for closing the service\n    data container (see TS 32.251\u00a0[11]), such as tariff time change, IP-CAN\n    bearer modification (e.g. QoS change, S-GW change, user location\n    change, user CSG information change), access change of service data\n    flow, indirect service condition change, service usage thresholds,\n    service idled out, termination or failure handling procedure. When one\n    of the \"CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI Change\" are reported as user\n    location change, the dedicated value in service Condition Change is set\n    instead of the generic \"user location change\" value. This field is\n    specified as bitmask for support of multiple change trigger (e.g. S-GW\n    and QoS change). This field is derived from Change-Condition AVP at\n    Service-Data-Container AVP level defined in TS 32.299\u00a0[50] when\n    received on Rf. Each value is mapped to the corresponding value in\n    \"ServiceConditionChange\" field. When simultaneous change triggers are\n    met, multiple Change-Condition values are set in field bitmask.When no\n    Change-Condition AVP is provided, the \"recordClosure\" value is set for\n    the service data container. For envelope reporting, the Service\n    Condition Change value shall always take the value \"envelopeClosure\".\n    The mechanism for creating the envelope is identified within the Time\n    Quota Mechanism field.\n\n  -  EPC Qos Information in service specific service data containers\n    contains the QoS applied for the service.   This is included in the\n    first service data container. In following container EPC QoS\n    information is present if previous change condition is \"QoS change\".\n    The P-GW/TDF/IPE-CDR shall include only one EPC QoS Information\n    occurrence to one service data container.\n\n  -  Serving Node Address contains the valid serving node (e.g. SGSN/S-GW)\n    control plane IP address during the service data container recording\n    interval.\n\n  -  Data Volume Uplink and Downlink, includes the number of octets\n    transmitted during the service data container recording interval in the\n    uplink and/or downlink direction, respectively. The amount of data\n    counted in P-GW shall be as specified in clauses 5.2.1.10.1, 5.3.1.1\n    and 5.3.1.6.1 of TS 32.251\u00a0[11]. The amount of data counted in TDF\n    shall be based on full payload of the data transferred. The amount of\n    data counted in IP-Edge shall be based on full payload of the data\n    transferred.\n\n  -  Report Time is a time stamp, which defines the moment when the service\n    data container is closed.\n\n  -  Service Identifier is an identifier for a service. The service\n    identifier may designate an end user service, a part of an end user\n    service or an arbitrarily formed group thereof.

This is included in the\n    service data container only if previous container's change condition is\n    \"user location change\". Note the \"3GPP2 user location information\" in\n    PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR main level contains the location where the UE was when\n    PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  UWAN User Location Information contains the Untrusted Wireless Access\n    Network (UWAN) user location during the service data container\n    recording interval. This is included in the service data container only\n    if previous container\u2019s change condition is \"user location change\".\n    Note the user location information in PGW-CDR main level contains the\n    location where the UE was when PGW-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  TWAN User Location Information contains the user location in a Trusted\n    WLAN Access Network during the service data container recording\n    interval.

Note\n    the user location information in PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR main level contains\n    the location where the UE was when PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  User CSG information contains the status of the user accessing a CSG\n    cell (CSG ID within the PLMN, Access mode and indication on CSG\n    membership) during the service data container recording interval. This\n    is included in the service data container only if previous container\u2019s\n    change condition is \"user CSG information change\". Note the \"user CSG\n    information\" in PGW-CDR main level contains the \"user CSG information\"\n    when PGW-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  AF-Record-Information includes the \"AF Charging Identifier\" (ICID for\n    IMS) and associated flow identifiers generated by the AF and received\n    by the P-GW over Gx interfaces as defined in TS 29.212 [220]. In case\n    usage of PCC rules, which usage is reported within the container, has\n    different AF-Record-Information then the P-GW shall include all\n    occurrences to the service data container.\n\n  -  Event Based Charging Information includes the number of events and\n    associated timeStamps (each event is timestamped) during the service\n    data container recording interval.\n\n  -  Time Quota Mechanism contains two further subfields and is included if\n    envelope reporting is required:\n\n    -  Time Quota Type identifies the mechanism by which time based usage\n       should be reported \u2013 as defined in\u00a0TS\u00a032.299 [50].\n\n    -  Base Time Interval identifies the length of the base time interval,\n       for controlling the reporting of time based usage, in seconds.\n\n  -  Service Specific Info holds service specific data for a pre-defined\n    PCC or a predefined ADC rule that is used for enhanced packet\n    filtering.\n\n  -  Sponsor Identity identifies the sponsor willing to pay for the\n    operator's charge for connectivity.\n\n  -  Application Service Provider Identity identifies application service\n    provider that is delivering a service to an end user.\n\n  -  RAT Type contains the RAT type for the IP-CAN bearer that is first\n    reported for the Rating Group or Rating Group / Service Identifier in\n    the container. If traffic from multiple bearers is included in the\n    report for the container, only one field is included.\n\n  NOTE:  Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity are not\n         used together with Service Identification reporting. Furthermore,\n         neither the Sponsor Identity nor Application Service Provider\n         Identity is applicable to the TDF.\n\n  -  Related Change of Service Condition indicates the reason a related\n    container was closed when the current container is indirectly closed\n    and the supplemental information for the event.

This means that if QoS control within one IP-CAN bearer is\napplicable in S-GW, P-GW, ePDG and TWAG, there can be several containers\nopen at same time one per each applied QCI/ARP pair.\n\nEach container includes the following fields:\n\n  -  Data Volume Uplink, Data Volume Downlink, Change Condition and Change\n    Time.\n\n  -  Data Volume Uplink includes the number of octets transmitted during\n    the use of the packet data services in the uplink direction. In MBMS\n    charging, this field is normally to be set to zero, because MBMS\n    charging is based on the volume of the downlink data. The counting of\n    uplink data volumes is optional. In S-CDR this field is not present\n    when the SGSN has successfully established Direct Tunnel between the\n    RNC and the GGSN.\n\n  -  Data Volume Downlink includes the number of octets transmitted during\n    the use of the packet data services in the downlink direction. In S-CDR\n    this field is not present when the SGSN has successfully established\n    Direct Tunnel between the RNC and the GGSN.\n\n  -  Change Condition defines the reason for closing the container (see TS\n    32.251\u00a0[11]), such as tariff time change, QoS change or closing of the\n    CDR. This field is derived from Change-Condition AVP Traffic-Data-\n    Volumes AVP level defined in TS 32.299\u00a0[40] when received on Rf. Each\n    value is mapped to the corresponding value in \"ChangeCondition\" field.\n    When no Change-Condition AVP is provided, the \"recordClosure\" value is\n    set for the container. For User Location Change, when one of the\n    \"CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI Change\" are reported as user location\n    change, the dedicated value in service Condition Change is set instead\n    of the generic \"user location change\" value.\n\n  -  Change Time is a time stamp, which defines the moment when the volume\n    container is closed or the CDR is closed. All the active IP-CAN bearers\n    do not need to have exactly the same time stamp e.g. due to same tariff\n    time change (variance of the time stamps is implementation and traffic\n    load dependent, and is out of the scope of standardisation).\n\n  -  User Location Information contains the location (e.g. CGI/SAI,\n    ECGI/TAI or RAI) where the UE is located and used during the transfer\n    of the data volume captured by the container (applicable only to the\n    SGW-CDR). This is included in the Traffic data container only if\n    previous container's change condition is \"user location change\". Note\n    the user location information in SGW-CDR main level contains the\n    location where the UE was when SGW-CDR was opened, and the \"Last user\n    location information\" in SGW-CDR main level contains the location where\n    the UE was when SGW-CDR is closed.\n\n  -  UWAN User Location Information contains the Untrusted Wireless Access\n    Network (UWAN) user location during the transfer of the data volume\n    captured by the container. This is included in the Traffic data\n    container only if previous container's change condition is \"user\n    location change\". Note the user location information in ePDG-CDR main\n    level contains the location where the UE was when ePDG-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  TWAN User Location Information contains the user location in a Trusted\n    WLAN Access Network during the the transfer of the data volume captured\n    by the container. This is included in the Traffic data container only\n    if previous container\u2019s change condition is \"user location change\".\n    Note the user location information in TWAG-CDR main level contains the\n    location where the UE was when TWAG-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  Presence Reporting Area Status contains the status of the UE presence\n    (i.e. indication on whether the UE is inside or outside) in the\n    Presence Reporting Area(s) identified by \"Presence Reporting Area\n    identifier(s)\" contained in SGW-CDR main level. This is included in the\n    Traffic data container when the initial status is reported after\n    opening of SGW-CDR, or if previous container\u2019s change condition is\n    \"Presence in Presence Reporting Area Change\". This field is not\n    applicable in multiple PRA(s).\n\n  -  List of Presence Reporting Area Information contains the list of\n    Presence Reporting Area Information. Each Presence Reporting Area\n    Information includes the \"Presence Reporting Area identifier\", the\n    status of the UE presence (i.e. indication on whether the UE is inside\n    or outside the Presence Reporting Area or Presence Reporting Area(s)\n    inactive). In the PGW it contains the Node (PCRF, OCS) which subscribed-\n    to the PRA.\n\n  -  User CSG information contains the status of the user accessing a CSG\n    cell (CSG ID within the PLMN, Access mode and indication on CSG\n    membership) during the transfer of the data volume captured by the\n    container. This is included in the Traffic data container only if\n    previous container\u2019s change condition is \"user CSG information change\".\n    Note the \"user CSG information\" in S-CDR/SGW-CDR main level contains\n    the \"user CSG information\" when S-CDR/SGW-CDR was opened.\n\n  -  EPC QoS Information In case of IP-CAN bearer specific container this\n    contains authorized QoS for the IP-CAN bearer. First container for each\n    QCI/ARP pair includes this field. In following containers this field is\n    present if previous change condition is \"QoS change\". This field is\n    applicable only in SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR, and TWAG-CDR.\n\nIn S-CDR first container includes following optional fields: QoS Requested\nand QoS Negotiated. In following containers QoS Negotiated is present if\nprevious change condition is \"QoS change\". In addition to the QoS\nNegotiated parameter the QoS Requested parameter is present in following\ncontainers if the change condition is \"QoS change\" and the QoS change was\ninitiated by the MS via a IP-CAN bearer modification procedure.\n\nTable 5.1.2.2.25.1 illustrates an examplefor S-CDR but same principles are\napplicable also for SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR and TWAG-CDR. There\nare five containers (sets of volume counts) caused by one QoS change, one\nlocation change, one tariff time change and one Direct Tunnel establishment\n(direct tunnel change applicable in S-CDR only). When CDR is opened the\nsubscriber is in CGI1.\n\n          Table 5.1.2.2.25.1: Example list of traffic data volumes\n\n|QoS Requested =   |QoS Requested =    |                  |\n|QoS1              |QoS2 (if requested |                  |\n|                  |by the MS)         |                  |\n|QoS Negotiated =  |QoS Negotiated =   |                  |\n|QoS1              |QoS2               |Data Volume Uplink|\n|                  |                   |= 10              |\n|Data Volume Uplink|Data Volume Uplink |Data Volume       |\n|= 1               |= 5                |Downlink = 3      |\n|Data Volume       |Data Volume        |                  |\n|Downlink = 2      |Downlink = 6       |Change Condition =|\n|                  |                   |CGI/SAI Change    |\n|Change Condition =|Change Condition = |Time Stamp = TIME3|\n|QoS change        |Tariff change      |                  |\n|Time Stamp = TIME1|Time Stamp = TIME2 |                  |\n\n\n|                  |                   |\n|Data Volume Uplink|                   |\n|= 3               |Change Condition = |\n|Data Volume       |Record closed      |\n|Downlink = 4      |Time Stamp = TIME5 |\n|                  |                   |\n|User Location Info|                   |\n|= CGI2            |                   |\n|                  |                   |\n|Change Condition =|                   |\n|Direct Tunnel     |                   |\n|establishment     |                   |\n|Occurrence        |                   |\n|Time Stamp = TIME4|                   |\n\n\nFirst container includes initial QoS values and corresponding volume\ncounts. Second container includes new QoS values and corresponding volume\ncounts before tariff time change. Third container includes the indication\nof location change and corresponding volume counts before the location\nchange and after the tariff time change. Fourth container includes volume\ncounts after the location change and contains the indication of Direct\nTunnel establishment. Last container includes no volume count as it refers\nto Direct Tunnel establishment. The total volume counts can be itemised as\nshown in Table\u00a05.1.2.2.25.2 (tariff1 is used before and tariff2 after the\ntariff time change):\n\n  Table 5.1.2.2.25.2: Itemised list of total volume count corresponding to\n                             table 5.1.2.2.25.1\n\n|            |                   |Container   |\n|QoS1+Tariff1|uplink = 1,        |1           |\n|            |downlink = 2       |            |\n|QoS2+Tariff1|uplink = 5,        |2           |\n|            |downlink = 6       |            |\n|QoS2+Tariff2|uplink = 13,       |3+4         |\n|            |downlink = 7       |            |\n|QoS1        |uplink = 1,        |1           |\n|            |downlink = 2       |            |\n|QoS2        |uplink = 18,       |2+3+4       |\n|            |downlink = 13      |            |\n|Tariff1     |uplink = 6,        |1+2         |\n|            |downlink = 8       |            |\n|Tariff2     |uplink = 13,       |3+4         |\n|            |downlink = 7       |            |\n|CGI1        |uplink = 16,       |1+2+3       |\n|            |downlink = 11      |            |\n|CGI2        |uplink = 3,        |4           |\n|            |downlink = 4       |            |\n|No Direct   |uplink = 19,       |1+2+3+4     |\n|Tunnel      |downlink = 15      |            |\n|Direct      |-, -               |5           |\n|Tunnel      |                   |            |\n\n\nThe amount of data counted in the S-GW shall be the payload of the user\nplane at the S1-U/S4/S2interface. Therefore the data counted already\nincludes the IP PDP bearer protocols i.e. IP or PPP.\n\nThe data volume counted in the SGSN is dependent on the system. For GSM\nSGSN the data volume is the payload of the SNDCP PDUs at the Gb interface.\nFor UMTS-SGSN it is the GTP-U PDUs at the Iu-PS interface. Therefore, in\nboth systems, the data counted already includes the overheads of any PDP\nbearer protocols.\n\nIn GSM, in order to avoid that downstream packets transmitted from the old\nSGSN to the new SGSN at inter SGSN RA update induce the increase of the PDP\nCDR downstream volume counters in both SGSN the following rules must be\nfollowed:\n\n  -  For PDP contexts using LLC in unacknowledged mode: an SGSN shall\n    update the PDP CDR when the packet has been sent by the SGSN towards\n    the MS;\n\n     For PDP contexts using LLC in acknowledged mode, a GSM-SGSN shall only\n    update the PDP CDR at the reception of the acknowledgement by the MS of\n    the correct reception of a downstream packet.

32.297 [52] specifies the file based protocol for the \"Bx\" interface\nbetween the CDR generating node, i.e. the Charging Gateway Functionality,\nand the operator's Billing Domain (BD) (refer to TS 32.240 [1] for details\non the charging architecture). The following subclauses define\n\n  - the various CDR encodings that are standardised within 3GPP,\n\n  - a method how to indicate the encoding applied to the CDRs,\n\n  - a version indication of the encoded CDRs.\n\nThe latter two items can be used by the system(s) in the BD to easily\ndetect the encoding version used. See TS\u00a032.297\u00a0[52] for a detailed\ndescription on how this information is used on the Bx interface.\n\n\n6.1  3GPP standardized encodings\n\nThe contents of the CDRs sent on the Bx interface are defined by the ASN.1\nlanguage clause 5. A number of transfer syntaxes, or encodings, is\nspecified for use in 3GPP systems as follows. For the CDR transfer via the\nBx interface, as defined in TS 32.297\u00a0[52], the Basic Encoding Rules (ITU-T\nRecommendation X.690 [301]) encoding must be supported by all 3GPP systems.\nOptionally, other additional CDR encodings, i.e. Packed Encoding Rules (ITU-\nT Recommendation X.691 [302]) and XML Encoding Rules (ITU-T Recommendation\nXER [303]) may also be offered.\n\nThe encoding applied to the CDRs is indicated by means of the \"Data Record\nFormat\" parameter. The following \"Data Record Format\" values are used:\n\n  - \"1\" signifies the use of Basic Encoding Rules (BER);\n\n  - \"2\" signifies the use of unaligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);\n\n  - \"3\" signifies the use of aligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);\n\n  - \"4\" signifies the use of XML Encoding Rules (XER).\n\n\n"}, {"key": "following apply", "desc": ""}, {"key": "Billing Domain", "desc": "part of the operator network, which is outside the core\nnetwork, which receives and processes CDR files from the core network\ncharging functions.
