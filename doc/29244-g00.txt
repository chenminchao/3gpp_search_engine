1	Scope
The present document specifies the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP) used on the interface between the control plane and the user plane function. 
PFCP shall be used over:
-the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and the combined Sxa/Sxb reference points specified in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
- the Sxa' and Sxb' reference points specified in 3GPP TS 33.107 [20]. In the rest of this specification, no difference is made between Sxa and Sxa', or between Sxb and Sxb'. The Sxa' and Sxb' reference points reuse the protocol specified for the Sxa and Sxb reference points, but comply in addition with the security requirements specified in clause 8 of 3GPP 33.107 [20]. 
	the N4 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
In this specification the term CP function applies to control plane nodes such as SGW-C, PGW-C, TDF-C and SMF.
In this specification the term UP function applies to control plane nodes such as SGW-U, PGW-U, TDF-U and UPF.
The prefix PFCP in message and procedure names is used to indicate that messages and procedures are common and used on Sx and N4 reference point. A PFCP session refers to both Sx and/or N4 sessions. PFCP association are describing procedures to establish associations between EPC nodes (SGW-C/PGW-C/TDF-C and SGW-U/PGW-U/TDF-U) and also between 5G nodes (SMF and UPF).
In the related stage 2 specifications the prefix Sx and N4 is used for these common procedures realised by PFCP
Clauses or paragraphs that only apply to EPC or 5GC are indicated by the label "for EPC" or "for 5GC".

5	General description
5.1	Introduction
The architecture reference model with Control and User Plane Separation of EPC nodes is described in clause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. 
The architecture reference model with SMF and UPF of 5GC nodes is described in clause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
This clause specifies the high level principles of the PFCP protocol and describe how 3GPP functionalities are realised on the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points, e.g. Packet Forwarding, Policy and Charging Control, Lawful Interception.
5.2	Packet Forwarding Model
5.2.1	General
The packet forwarding scenarios supported over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. 
The packet forwarding scenarios supported over the N4 reference point are specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
The CP function controls the packet processing in the UP function by establishing, modifying or deleting PFCP Session contexts and by provisioning (i.e. adding, modifying or deleting) PDRs, FARs, QERs, URRs, BAR and/or MAR or by activating/deactivating pre-defined PDRs, FARs, QERs, URRs, per PFCP session context, whereby an PFCP session context may correspond:
-	for EPC, to an individual PDN connection, a TDF session, or a standalone session not tied to any PDN connection or TDF session used e.g. for forwarding Radius, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the PGW-C and the PDN. 
-	for 5GC, to an individual PDU session or a standalone PFCP session not tied to any PDU session.
Each PDR shall contain a PDI, i.e. one or more match fields against which incoming packets are matched, and may be associated to the following rules providing the set of instructions to apply to packets matching the PDI:
-	one or more FARs, which contains instructions related to the processing of the packets as follows:
-	an Apply Action parameter, which indicates whether the UP function shall forward, duplicate, drop or buffer the packet with or without notifying the CP function about the arrival of a DL packet;
-	forwarding, buffering and/or duplicating parameters, which the UP function shall use if the Apply Action parameter requests the packets to be forwarded, buffered or duplicated respectively. These parameters may remain configured in the FAR regardless of the Apply Action parameter value, to minimize the changes to the FAR during the transitions of the UE between the idle and connected modes. The buffering parameters, when present, shall be provisioned in a BAR created at the PFCP session level and referenced by the FAR.
NOTE 1:	Buffering refers here to the buffering of the packet in the UP function. The UP function is instructed to forward DL packets to the CP function when applying buffering in the CP function. See clause 5.3.1.
-	zero, one or more QERs, which contains instructions related to the QoS enforcement of the traffic;
-	zero, one or more URRs, which contains instructions related to traffic measurement and reporting.
-	one MAR when the PDR is used for matching downlink traffic towards the UE, which contain instructions to apply ATSSS feature for a N4 session established for a MA PDU session. See clause 5.2.7.
NOTE 2:	A downlink PDR can be associated with two FARs for a N4 session established for a MA PDU session as a MAR contains two FARs for 3GPP and non-3GPP respectively.
A FAR, a QER, a URR and a MAR shall only be associated to one or multiple PDRs of the same PFCP session context. 
The QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be assigned by the CP function to correlate QERs from multiple PFCP session contexts. For instance, the enforcement of APN-AMBR in the PGW-U shall be achieved by setting the same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID to the QERs from different PFCP sessions associated with all the PDRs corresponding to the non-GBR bearers of all the UE's PDN connections to the same APN. The QERs that are associated to the same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID in multiple PFCP sessions shall be provisioned, with the same QER contents, in each of these PFCP sessions. The QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be only used to enforce the APN-AMBR when the UE is in EPC, it may be provided by the CP function over N4 to the UP function for a PDU session may move to EPC in a later stage.
The following principles shall apply for the provisioning of PDRs in the UP function:
-	The CP function shall not provision more than one PDR with the same match fields in the PDI (i.e. with the same set of match fields and with the same value). The CP function may provision PDRs with the same value for a subset of the match fields of the PDI but not all; 
-	different PDRs of a same PFCP session may overlap, e.g. the CP function may provision two PDRs which differ by having one match field set to a specific value in one PDR and the same match field not included in the other PDR (thus matching any possible value); 
-	different PDRs of different PFCP sessions shall not overlap, i.e. there shall be at least one PDR in each PFCP session which differs by at least one different (and not wildcarded) match field in their PDI, such that any incoming user plane packet may only match PDRs of a single PFCP session; 
NOTE 2:	It is allowed for instance to provision in a PGW-U a same uplink PDR, matching any uplink traffic towards a particular application server's IP address, in two different PFCP sessions of two different UEs, as long as each PFCP session is also provisioned with another uplink PDR set with the respective UE IP address and/or uplink F-TEIDu, which allows the PGW-U to identify the PFCP session to which the packet corresponds.
-	As an exception to the previous principle, the CP function may provision a PDR with all match fields wildcarded (i.e. all match fields omitted in the PDI) in a separate PFCP session, to control how the UP function shall process packets unmatched by any PDRs of any other PFCP session. The CP function may provision the UP function to send these packets to the CP function or to drop them. The UP function shall grant the lowest precedence to this PDR.
On receipt of a user plane packet, the UP function shall perform a lookup of the provisioned PDRs and:
-	identify first the PFCP session to which the packet corresponds; and
-	find the first PDR matching the incoming packet, among all the PDRs provisioned for this PFCP session, starting with the PDRs with the highest precedence and continuing then with PDRs in decreasing order of precedence. Only the highest precedence PDR matching the packet shall be selected, i.e. the UP function shall stop the PDRs lookup once a matching PDR is found.
A packet matches a PDR if all the match fields which are identified with different IE type in the PDI of the PDR are matching the corresponding packet header fields unless specified otherwise. If a match field is not included in the PDI, it shall be considered as matching all possible values in the header field of the packet. If the match field is present and does not include a mask, the match field shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet if it has the same value. If the match field is present and includes a mask (e.g. IP address with a prefix mask), the match field shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet if it has the same value for the bits which are set in the mask. If a match field has multiple instances, i.e. there are several IEs with the same IE type, a packet matches this match field if any instance is matching the corresponding packet header field.
The match fields of the PDI shall correspond to outer and/or inner packet header fields, e.g. uplink bearer binding verification in the PGW-U may be achieved by configuring a PDR with the PDI containing the local GTP-U F-TEID (for outer IP packet matching) and the SDF filters of the data flows mapped to the bearer (for inner IP packet matching). 
NOTE 3:	A DL PDR can be provisioned with a UE IP address together with a Framed-Route or a Framed-IPv6-Rotue either in the PDI IE or in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE; in such case, the PDR is matched if the packet matches either the UE IP address or the Framed-Route (Framed-IPv6-Route).
When one or more pre-defined PDR(s) are activated for a given PDR (see clause 5.19), an incoming packet matches the PDR if it matches one of activated pre-defined PDR(s).
The UP function should drop packets unmatched by any PDRs.
The packet processing flow in the UP function is illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-1.

Figure 5.2.1-1: Packet processing flow in the UP function
At the deletion of an PFCP session, the UP function shall delete the PFCP session context and all the associated non-preconfigured rules. 
NOTE 3:	Deleting a QER in one PFCP session does not result in deleting another QER in another PFCP session even when these two QERs have the same QER ID and/or are associated with the same QER Correlation ID.
A UP Function controlled by multiple CP functions shall handle Rule IDs from the different CP functions independently from each other.
Rule ID used for PDR, FAR, BAR, QER, URR or MAR is uniquely identifying a rule of the corresponding rule type within a session.
5.2.1A	Packet Detection Rule Handling 
5.2.1A.1	General
When provisioning a PDR in the UP function, the CP function shall provide the PDI with the following information: 
-	the source interface of the incoming packets;
-	a combination of the parameters, that incoming packets are requested to match, among: Local F-TEID, Network Instance, UE IP address, SDF Filter(s) and/or Application ID. For 5GC, the PDI may additionally contain one or more QFI(s) to detect traffic pertaining to specific QoS flow(s), Ethernet Packet Filter(s) and/or Ethernet PDU Session Information (see clause 5.13.1).
The requirements for provisioning an SDF filter in the PDI are specified in clauses 5.2.1A.2A and 5.2.1A.3.
The CP function may provision the parameters, that incoming packets are requested to match, in the UP function by: 
-	providing the parameters individually in each PDI of the PFCP session; or
-	optionally, if the PDI Optimization feature is supported by the UP function, by providing the parameters which may be common to multiple PDIs of a same PFCP session in a Traffic Endpoint IE and by referencing this Traffic Endpoint in the PDI(s) of the PFCP session. See clause 5.2.1A.2. A Traffic Endpoint may include a Local F-TEID, Network Instance, UE IP address and/or Ethernet PDU Session Information (see clause 5.13.1). 
NOTE:	A Traffic Endpoint can correspond to a GTP-u endpoint, an SGi or an N6 endpoint.
5.2.1A.2	PDI Optimization
PDI Optimization is an optional feature which may be supported by the CP and UP Functions. This feature allows the CP function to optimize the signaling towards the UP function by creating the information that are common to multiple PDRs as a Traffic Endpoint with a Traffic Endpoint ID and then referring to this common information from multiple PDRs. The Traffic Endpoint ID shall be unique within an PFCP session. When a PDI refers to a Traffic Endpoint, the parameters that are in the Traffic Endpoint shall not be once again provided in the PDI. The CP function may update the Traffic Endpoint at any time. 
If a Traffic Endpoint is updated, all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic Endpoint in the UP function shall use the updated information. 
If F-TEID allocation is performed in the UP function, the UP function shall allocate and store the F-TEID associated to the Traffic Endpoint. When the UP function provides the allocated F-TEID to the CP function in the PFCP Session Establishment response or PFCP Session Modification response message, the CP function shall update the Traffic Endpoint information stored in the CP function with the received F-TEID. 
The CP function should use a Traffic Endpoint ID created in a different PFCP message only after getting the confirmation from the UP function of the Traffic Endpoint ID creation. 
If the CP function deletes a Traffic Endpoint, the UP Function shall delete all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic Endpoint. 
NOTE 1:	The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1 for reporting usage reports to the CP function also apply if the deletion of the Traffic Endpoint results in deleting the last PDR associated to a URR. 
NOTE2:	For EPC, the Remove Traffic Endpoint IE can be used to delete a bearer for which multiple PDRs exist (with the same Traffic Endpoint ID).
5.2.1A.2A	Provisioning of SDF filters 
When provisioning an SDF Filter in a PDI, the CP function shall:
-	copy the Flow Description if it is received from the PCRF (or PCF), in the corresponding PDI of a PDR regardless of whether the PDR is for matching uplink or downlink traffic; 
NOTE 1	The Flow Description received from the PCRF (or PCF) is set assuming downlink flows only, see clause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The CP function uses the Flow-Direction AVP received from the PCRF (or PCF) to determine the actual direction and thus the source interface of the packet flows described in the Flow Description.
-	for traffic from CP-function or SGi-LAN:
-	If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the UE, the CP function shall provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule "source" parameters set to correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule "destination" parameters correspond to the UE;
-	If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the PDN, the CP function shall provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule "source" parameters set to correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule "destination" parameters correspond to the PDN.
The UP function shall apply the SDF filter based on the Source Interface of the PDR as follows (see also clause 8.2.5):
-	when the Source Interface is CORE, this indicates that the filter is for downlink data flow, so the UP function shall apply the Flow Description as is; 
-	when the Source Interface is ACCESS, this indicates that the filter is for uplink data flow, so the UP function shall swap the source and destination address/port in the Flow Description; 
-	when the Source Interface is CP-function or SGi-LAN, the UP function shall use the Flow Description as is.
5.2.1A.3	Bidirectional SDF Filters
The CP function may provision bidirectional SDF Filters in the UP function (see clause 8.2.5), i.e. SDF Filters that may be associated to both uplink and downlink PDRs of a same PFCP/N4 session, as follows:
-	when provisioning a bidirectional SDF Filter the first time for an PFCP/N4 session, the CP function shall provision the SDF filter definition together with a SDF Filter ID uniquely identifying the SDF Filter among all the SDF Filters provisioned for a given PFCP/N4 Session; 
-	the CP function may then provision a PDR for the same PFCP/N4 session but the opposite direction, by provisioning the SDF Filter ID in the SDF filter ID field of the PDI, without provisioning again the SDF filter definition; 
-	the UP function shall apply any modification of a bidirectional SDF Filter to all PDRs of the PFCP/N4 session making use of this SDF Filter; 
-	upon deletion of a PDR making use of a bidirectional SDF Filter, the UP function shall still apply the SDF Filter for any other PDR making use of the SDF Filter.
The requirements specified for provisioning SDF filters in clause 5.2.1A.2A shall also apply when provisioning bidirectional SDF Filters.
5.2.1A.4	Application detection with PFD
The detection information for a given application may be provisioned by the CP function to the UP function via PFD management procedure. See clause 6.2.5. 
The PFDE (PFD Enhancement) feature may be optionally supported by the CP function and UP function. When the feature is supported in both the CP function and UP function, the CP function may provision a PFD Contents IE including a property (i.e. either flow description, or URL or Domain Name/Domain Name Protocol) with multiple values.
NOTE 1:	It is assumed, when the PFDE feature is not supported, a PFD Contents can only include a property with one value.
When the UP function attempts to detect the traffic pertaining to an application by using the application's PFDs (see clause 7.4.3.1 and 8.2.39), the UP function shall consider:
-	the application is detected if the incoming traffic matches at least one PFD Contents; 
-	one PFD Contents is matched if the incoming traffic matches every property contained in the corresponding PFD Contents IE; the incoming traffic matches one property (i.e. flow description, URL and Domain Name/Domain Name Protocol) if it matches at least one value of the property.
NOTE 2:	Interpretation of the Custom PFD Content is implementation specific.
5.2.2	Usage Reporting Rule Handling 
5.2.2.1	General
The CP function shall provision URR(s) for a PFCP session in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP function to:
-	measure the network resources usage in terms of traffic data volume, duration (i.e. time) and/or events, according to the provisioned Measurement Method; and
-	send a usage report to the CP function, when the measurement reaches a certain threshold, periodically or when detecting a certain event, according to the provisioned Reporting Triggers or when an immediate report is requested within an PFCP Session Modification Request.
NOTE:	The UP function sends a usage report without performing network resources usage measurements when being requested to detect and report the the start of an SDF or application traffic.
5.2.2.2	Provisioning of Usage Reporting Rule in the UP function
5.2.2.2.1	General
When provisioning a URR, the CP function shall provide the reporting trigger(s) in the Reporting Triggers IE of the URR which shall cause the UP function to generate and send a Usage Report for this URR to the CP function. When adding or removing reporting trigger(s) to or from the URR, the CP function shall provide the new complete list of applicable reporting triggers in the Reporting Triggers IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request message.
For the volume-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
-	the Volume Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;
-	the Volume Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Volume Threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the measured traffic reaches the quota;
-	the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the downlink traffic that is being dropped reaches the threshold; and/or
NOTE 1:	For EPC, the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a SGW-U for triggering the PGW Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]). For 5GC, the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a UPF for triggering the SMF Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [29]).
-	a Measurement Information with the 'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag set to 1, to request the UP function to measure the traffic usage before any QoS enforcement.
For the time-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
-	a Time Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the measured traffic reaches the threshold; 
-	a Time Quota, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Time Threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the measured traffic reaches the quota; 
-	a Measurement Information with the "Immediate Start Time Metering" flag set to 1, to request the UP function to start time metering immediately at receiving the flag; otherwise, the UP function shall start time metering when the first packet is received; and/or
-	an Inactivity Detection Time, to request the UP function to suspend the time measurement when no packets are received during the provisioned Inactivity Detection Time. The time measurement shall then be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. If an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time has been provided by the CP function, the time measurement shall be performed continuously until a new non-zero Inactivity Detection Time is received or the time-based usage measurement is stopped. See Figure 5.2.2.2-1:

Figure 5.2.2.2-1: IDT based charging
NOTE 2:	The Inactivity Detection Time can be set to the Quota Consumption Timer if received. The Inactivity Detection Time is not used to control when the time metering starts.
-	For EPC, a Time Quota Mechanism, including a Base Time Interval Type, which is either Continuous Time Period (CTP) or Discrete Time Period (DTP), and a Base Time Interval (BTI), to the UP function. See clause 6.5.7 in 3GPP TS 32.299[18].
-	For CTP (Continuous Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time that traffic has occurred up to the first Base Time Interval (BTI) which contains no traffic. The time measurement shall include the last Base Time Interval, i.e. the one which contained no traffic. The time measurement resumes by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-2:

Figure 5.2.2.2-2: CTP based charging
-	For DTP (Descrete Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time that traffic has occurred up to the Base Time Interval end. The time measurement shall be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-3:

Figure 5.2.2.2-3: DTP based charging
When the time-based measurement method applies, and when the Envelope Reporting is required for EPC, the CP function shall request the UP function to report the usage by setting the reporting trigger to Envelope Closure in addition to other Reporting Trigger(s), in the Reporting Triggers IE. The CP function may indicate the UP function to report for just time, time and volume, time and events, or time and volume and number of events by setting Measurement Method accordingly. The CP function may set the Reduced Application Detection Information flag in the Measurement Information of the URR, when requesting the detection of start and stop of an application solely for the purpose of envelope reporting for EPC.
The CP function may provision a Volume Threshold, a Volume Quota, or both (and/or respectively a Time Threshold, a Time Quota, or both). 
When both a Volume (or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Quota are provisioned, the UP function shall send a usage report only when reaching the Volume (or Time) Threshold; when subsequently reaching the Volume (or Time) Quota, the UP function shall stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) without sending a new usage report to the CP function.
NOTE 3:	For online charging, the Volume Threshold (or Time Threshold) can be set in a PGW-U or TDF-U to the value of the granted volume (or time) quota minus the volume (or time) quota threshold, such as to get a usage report from the UP function when the volume (or time) based credit falls below the remaining quota thresholds provided by the OCS.
NOTE 4:	The Volume Quota or Time Quota can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online charging to enable the traffic to be forwarded up to an intermediate or final quotas granted by the OCS. The CP function can provision both a Volume (or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Threshold to request the UP function to:
-	send a usage report when the consumed resources reach the volume (or time) usage threshold provided by the OCS, and 
-	to stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), without sending a second usage report, when the granted volume (or time) quota is exhausted.
For event based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
-	the Event Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report when the number of events reaches the event threshold;
-	the Event Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets applicable to the event (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Event threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the number of events reaches the event quota;
NOTE 5:	An event is preconfigured with one or more event detection logic in the UPF. Each event detection logic is associated with an Application ID. The CP function activates the detection and reporting of an event by provisioning PDR(s) with the PDI set to an Application ID and by provisioning a URR with an event threshold or event quota reporting trigger. The CP function identifies an event reported in a Usage Report by the URR ID.
For all the measurement methods (i.e. volume, time or event), the CP function may also provision:
-	a Quota Holding Time, to request the UP function to send a usage report and to also stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) when no packets have been received for the duration indicated in this parameter;
NOTE 6:	A Quota Holding Time can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online charging to request the UP function to send a Usage Report when the Quota Holding Time provided by the OCS (see 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]) expires. The UP function can be instructed in the same Usage Reporting Rule with the Report Triggers  -  START to generate a new Usage Report upon receiving any subsequent packets associated with this URR.
-	a Monitoring Time IE and zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs, to request the UP function to measure the network resources usage before and after the monitoring time in separate counts and to re-apply the volume and/or time, and/or event thresholds at the monitoring time. The CP function may additionally provision a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE and/or a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE, for a volume (or time or event) based measurement. When being provisioned with a Monitoring Time, the UP function shall:
-	reset its usage thresholds at the monitoring time to the value provided in the Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE, if provisioned in the URR, or to the remaining value of the Volume (or Time or Event) threshold used before the monitoring time (i.e. excluding the already accumulated volume or time usage); 
-	shall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the Monitoring time in the first usage report after the Monitoring Time is reached;
-	a Measurement Period, indicating the period to generate periodic usage reports to the CP function. 
Action" IE identifying the substitute FAR the UP function shall apply, for the traffic identified by the PDR to which the URR is associated, when exhausting any of these quotas. This FAR may require the UP function to drop the packets or redirect the traffic towards a redirect destination as specified in clause 5.4.7.
NOTE 7:	A PDR can be associated with multiple URRs. If one of these URRs requires the UP function to drop the user data packets, e.g. when the Quota has been exhausted, the other URRs associated to the PDR need also to stop their measurements, except for URRs including the Measurement Information with the 'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement' flag set to 1.
The CP function may request at any time the UP function to activate or deactivate a network resources usage measurement, using the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR. 
NOTE 8:	This can be used in a PGW-U for the PGW Pause of Charging procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]).
5.2.2.2.2	Credit pooling (for EPC)
For EPC, when the Credit Pool feature is supported and the CP function (e.g. PGW-C) is instructed to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session, the CP function shall create a URR for the Credit Pool, and in this URR, the CP function:
-	shall include one Aggregated URR ID IE per URR sharing the credit pool, including the URR ID of the URR sharing the credit pool and the associated Multiplier to measure the abstract service units the corresponding traffic consumes from the credit pool;
-	shall set the Time or Volume Threshold or Quota IE to the value calculated as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16] according to the Measurement Method.
            NOTE 1:	The value can be calculated using the following formula:
            	S = Q1*M1 + Q2*M2 + ... + Qn*Mn, 
where the S is the quota for the credit pool, Qn is the quota and Mn is the multiplier for each Rating Group (RG) which are provided via the Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS. 
A URRn is defined for each of RG. 
            NOTE 2:	When the Measurement Method is set to the combined volume/duration, the Time and Volume	Threshold or Quota are calculated indepentently.
-	may set the Reporting Trigger to reporting upon reaching a volume or time threshold or quota;
-	may set the Measurement Method to the data volume, duration (i.e. time), combined volume/duration according to the Measurement Method set in the URRs in the Credit Pool.
            NOTE 3:	The UP function is instructed to handle a Credit Pool when a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP is included within a Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS. A Credit Pool is identified by the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP. See clause 6.3.11, 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18].
In addition, the CP function shall also include the Linked URR IE, set to the Credit Pool URR ID, in all the URRs which are sharing the credit pool (i.e. which are associatied with RGs sharing the Credit Pool). 
5.2.2.3	Reporting of Usage Report to the CP function
5.2.2.3.1	General
When detecting that a provisioned reporting trigger occurs, the UP function shall generate a Usage Report for the related URR and send it to the CP function by initiating the PFCP Session Report procedure. 
When providing usage report information for a URR in a message, the UP function shall include the UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) identifying the order in which a Usage Report is generated for the given URR. The UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) shall be set to "0" for the first Usage Report and incremented for every subsequent Usage Report generated by the UP function for the URR. The UP function shall also indicate the trigger that causes the usage report to be generated in the Usage Report Trigger IE.
Upon generating a usage report for a URR towards the CP function, the UP function shall:
-	reset its ongoing measurement counts for the related URR (i.e. the UP function shall report in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since the last usage report for that URR);
-	re-apply all the thresholds (Volume/Time/Event Threshold) provisioned for the related URR, if the usage report was triggered due to one of  the thresholds being reached; and
-	continue to apply all the provisioned URR(s) and perform the related network resources usage measurement(s), until getting any further instruction from the CP function.
When receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a measurement that is already ongoing in the UP function, the UP function shall consider its ongoing measurements counts for the related URR against the new threshold or quota to determine when to send its next usage report to the CP function. At receiving a new quota with value set to zero, the UP function shall:
-	apply the FAR identified in the FAR ID for Quota Action IE if the CP function has provisioned it, otherwise the UP function shall stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), and 
-	report in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since the last usage report for that URR.
NOTE 1:	The UP function determines when to send its next usage report to the CP function by deducting from the newly provisioned threshold or quota the traffic it has forwarded since its last usage report. As an example, if the UP function has forwarded 10 Mbytes of traffic since it last usage report to the CP function and the CP function provisions a new volume threshold or quota of 100 Mbytes, the UP function sends its next usage report upon forwarding an additional 90 Mbytes traffic. 
NOTE 2:	When receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a measurement that is already ongoing in the UP function and if the UP function has already generated the usage report but had not sent it, the UP function can send the usage report before performing the update of the URR.
When reporting the network resources usage before and after a Monitoring Time, the UP function shall send two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network resource usage was consumed before or after the Monitoring Time. Omission of this IE in a Usage Report indicates that no monitoring time has occurred. The UP function shall send Usage Reports soon after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time.
NOTE 3:	The UP function needs to take care to smooth the signalling load towards the CP function if Usage Reports need to be generated for a large number of PFCP sessions after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time.
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall report the traffic usage after any QoS enforcement. Additionally, if the CP function requested to measure the traffic usage before QoS enforcement, the UP function shall also report corresponding measurements, when measurements needs to be reported for the traffic usage after QoS enforcement, by sending two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network resource usage corresponds to the traffic before or after QoS enforcement. Thresholds provisioned in a URR shall apply to the traffic usage after any QoS enforcement. 
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall include all the counters (Total, Uplink and Downlink) of the URR in the Volume Measurement IE in the Usage Report IE.
A usage report triggered only due to the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold shall not contain any measurement information. 
When being instructed to remove a URR or the last PDR associated to a URR, the UP function shall include a Usage Report in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in an additional PFCP Session Report Request if there are non-null measurements to report for the URR, and shall reset its ongoing measurements for the URR that is removed, or dissociated from the last PDR.
When being instructed to deactivate a network resources usage measurement via the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR, the UP function shall stop measuring the network resources usage (against the volume/time/event threshold/quota) and store the current measurement counts which will be resumed when the URR is activated again. The UP function shall not generate a usage report upon the deactivation of the URR and it shall send a usage report during the period when the URR is deactivated for the following scenarios:
-	if the Quota Holding Time is expired and if the reporting trigger QUHTI is set;
NOTE 4:	The Quota Holding Time can have been started before the URR is deactivated or starts from the moment when the URR is deactivated since no quota will be consumed.
-	if it is the time for a periodic reporting and if the reporting trigger PERIO is set;
-	if it is required to send a usage report for this URR when a usage report is reported for a linked URR and if the reporting trigger LIUSA is set;
-	if it is required to send an immeditate report upon a query for the URR, or the URR is removed, dissociated from the last PDR.
NOTE 5:	Multiple usage reports can be required to be reported to the CP function when deleting a PDR that is the last one to be associated to multiple URRs.
The CP function may request the UP function, in an PFCP Session Modification Request, to report its ongoing network resources measurement for one or multiple URRs of the PFCP session. In this case, the UP function shall:
-	generate usage report(s) (based on the existing definition of any URR(s) included in the PFCP Session Modification Request message before any update) for the URR(s) being queried and for any associated linked usage reports (see clause 5.2.2.4) for which there are non-null measurements to report,
-	include them in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in additional PFCP Session Report Request messages; and 
-	proceed as specified above upon generating a usage report for a URR towards the CP function, with the following additions: 
-	if the PFCP Session Modification Request includes the Update URR IE (for the URR being queried) with a Volume or Time Threshold, the UP function shall re-apply the threshold received in the request; 
-	otherwise, if a threshold had been set for the URR that is queried, since the usage report is not triggered due to the threshold being reached, the UP function shall adjust the threshold by subtracting the time/volume reported in the usage report to determine when to generate the next report.
NOTE 6:	Upon reaching a threshold that was adjusted due to a URR query as specified above, the UP function re-applies then the threshold that was provisioned in the URR (i.e. not the value of the adjusted threshold). 
NOTE 7:	The CP function can query a URR without including a Volume or Time Threshold in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a traffic volume/service container (see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]). 
NOTE 8:	The CP function can query a URR including a Volume or Time Threshold in the PFCP Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a CDR (see clause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]). In such a case, the CP function can include the same threshold for the URR being queried in the Update URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request message to trigger the UP function to re-apply the threshold.
NOTE 9:	It is up to the CP function to request the UP function to generate an immediate report (or not) as specified above when the CP function modifies a URR or any other rules of the PFCP session. As an exception, the UP function always generates an immediate report when being instructed to remove a URR.
When additional PFCP Session Report Request messages need to be sent, the UP function shall indicate, either in the PFCP Session Modification Response or in one PFCP Session Report Request, how many usage reports will be sent in PFCP Session Report Request messages. If this is indicated in one PFCP Session Report Request, the PFCP Session Modification Response shall indicate that more reports will follow by setting the AURI flag of the Additional Usage Reports Information IE. Besides, if the PFCP Session Modification Request included the Query URR Reference IE, usage reports sent in response to the query in the PFCP Session Modification Response and/or additional PFCP Session Report Request messages shall include the Query URR Reference IE set to the same value as received in the PFCP Session Modification Request.
When the reporting trigger "Envelope Closure" is set in the corresponding Usage Reporting Rule, the UP function shall generate a usage report with the measurement of the time and/or volume as instructed in the Measurement Method:
-	when the Inactivity Detection Time (if included) is expired; 
-	when detecting no usage for the first Base Time Interval if the Base Time Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to CTP; or
-	at the end of each of base time interval if the Base Time Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to DTP. 
NOTE 10:	Events (e.g. application detection information) are reported individually and independently from the usage report sent for envelope closure.
At the PFCP session termination, the UP function shall indicate to the CP function, in the PFCP Session Deletion Response, the resources that have been consumed for each URR that was provisioned in the PFCP session since the last usage report (respective to each URR).
Upon receiving the Usage Report from the UP function, the CP function may initiate PFCP Session Modification procedure as result of the communication with the PCRF or OCS, as described in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2], e.g. by: 
-	modifying the URR (e.g. changing the Volume/Time threshold, Volume/Time quota, disabling the usage monitoring);
-	creating a new FAR (e.g. for redirect) and/or modifying the existing FAR; or
-	modifying the QER (s) in the PFCP session.
5.2.2.3.2	Credit pooling
When a URR is received with at least one Aggregated URRs IE included, the UP function:
-	shall calculate the traffic usage of the URR by applying the Multiplier(s) and aggregating the traffic usage from all URRs indicated in the Aggregated URRs IE(s), as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16]; 
            NOTE 1:	The usage of this URR is calculated using the following formula:
            	C1*M1 + C2*M2 + ... + Cn*Mn = U, 
where U is the usage counted by this URR, Cn is the usage counted by each aggregated URR (i.e. URR for each RG sharing the credit pool), and Mn is the multiplier for each aggregrated URR.
-	shall generate a report when the counted usage exceeds the threshold;
-	shall generate a report if the threshold is not provided, and stop packets forwarding (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) for all Aggregated URRs when the counted usage exceeds the quota.
NOTE 2:	The handling of the aggregated URR(s), e.g. generating a Usage Report upon the Reporting Trigger(s) is not impacted by handling of this URR for the Credit Pool.
5.2.2.4	Reporting of Linked Usage Reports to the CP function
The CP function may instruct the UP function to generate a Usage Report for a URR "X" when a Usage Report is generated for another URR "Y", by:
-	provisioning the URR "X" with the Reporting Triggers IE set to Linked Usage Reporting; and
-	including in the URR "X" the Linked URR ID IE set to the URR ID of the URR "Y".
NOTE 1:	This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to report a Usage Report for an SDF (i.e. URR "X") when the UP function reports a Usage Report for a bearer (i.e. URR "Y").
NOTE 2:	This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to report a Usage Report for a RG (i.e. URR "X") when the UP function reports a Usage Report for a credit pool to which this RG pertain (i.e. URR "Y").
When a usage report is to be generated for the URR "Y", regardless of the condition which triggers the report, the UP function shall also send a Usage Report for the URR "X" with the accumulated usage information, and the Usage Report Trigger IE set to Linked Usage Reporting. 
NOTE 3:	This also applies e.g. when an immediate usage report is requested for the URR "Y"within a PFCP session Modification Request.
The URR "Y" may be linked to more URRs than just URR "X".
A RG level URR may be linked to IP-CAN bearer level URR as well as IP-CAN Session level URR to enable the CP function to generate a CDR on the different level. In such case, a URR "X" may link to more URRs than just URR "Y".
5.2.3	Forwarding Action Rule Handling
5.2.3.1	General
The CP function shall provision one and only one FAR for each PDR provisioned in an PFCP session. The FAR provides instructions to the UP function on how to process the packets matching the PDR.
By setting the appropriate flag(s) in the Apply Action IE in the FAR (see clause 8.2.26), the CP function may request the UP function to:
-	drop the packets, by setting the DROP flag;
-	forward the packets, by setting the FORW flag and by provisioning the Forwarding Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the packets;
-	buffer downlink packets by setting the BUFF flag and by optionally provisioning buffering parameters providing instructions on how to buffer the packets;
-	notify the CP function about the arrival of a first DL packet being buffered, by setting the NOCP flag;
-	duplicate the packets, by setting the DUPL flag and by provisioning the Duplicating Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the duplicated packets.
The CP function may request the UP function to duplicate packets that are to be dropped, forwarded or buffered.
The CP function may provision one or more FAR(s) per PFCP session. Different FARs of a same PFCP session may be provisioned with a different Apply Action flags, e.g. to enable the forwarding of downlink data packets for some PDRs while requesting to buffer downlink data packets for other PDRs.
NOTE 1:	This is necessary to establish or release a partial set of radio access bearers in UTRAN.
When instructed to buffer and notify the CP function about the arrival of a DL packet, the UP function shall notify the CP function, when it receives a first downlink packet for a given FAR, by sending an PFCP Session Report Request including a Downlink Data Report IE identifying the PDR(s) for which downlink packets have been received.
NOTE 2:	Receipt of downlink packets on PDRs associated to different FARs can result in sending multiple PFCP Session Report Request messages for the same PFCP session.
If the UP function indicated support of Header Enrichment of UL traffic (see clause 8.2.25), the CP function may provide the UP function with header enrichment information for uplink traffic, by including one or more Header Enrichment IE(s) in the FAR. In this case, the UP function should use this information to enrich the header of the uplink traffic (e.g. HTTP header enrichment).
NOTE 3:	It is not defined how to support SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms other than based on UDP/IP encapsulation (such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, GTP-C/U, see clause 4.3.17.8.3.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]) for Non-IP PDN connections.
If the UP function indicated support of PDI optimisation (see clause 8.2.25), the CP function may include in the forwarding parameters of the FAR the Linked Traffic Endpoint ID, if it is available, identifying the traffic Endpoint allocated for this PFCP session to receive the traffic in the reverse direction. 
NOTE 4:	This information can enable an SGW-U or PGW-U to correlate the UL and DL traffic (i.e. PDRs) sent over a same bearer. 
Assuming for instance an PFCP session provisioned in a PGW-U with: 
-	an UL PDR 1 (for an S5/S8 bearer 1) with Source Interface "Access" associated to an UL Traffic Endpoint ID "1" (comprising the IP address, a local TEID and optionally a network instance),
-	a DL PDR 1 with Source Interface "Core", UE IP address and SDF 1, 
the CP function sets the Linked Traffic Endpoint in the DL FAR 1 (associated to DL PDR 1) to the UL Traffic Endpoint "1", which allows the PGW-U to correlate the uplink and downlink PDRs for the same bearer (i.e. that UL PDR 1 associated to UL Traffic Endpoint "1", and DL PDR1 associated to DL FAR 1 with Linked Traffic Endpoint set to UL Traffic Endpoint "1", use the same S5/S8 bearer). 
NOTE 5:	The Linked Traffic Endpoint can possibly refer to a Traffic Endpoint in the reverse direction requested to be created  in the same PFCP request. 
5.2.4	Buffering Action Rule Handling 
5.2.4.1	General
A BAR provides instructions to control the buffering behaviour of the UP function for all the FARs of the PFCP session set with an Apply Action parameter requesting the packets to be buffered and associated to this BAR.
The CP function may create a BAR for an PFCP session and associate it to the FAR(s) of the PFCP session in an PFCP Session Establishment Request or an PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP function to apply a specific buffering behaviour for packets requested to be buffered and associated to this BAR.
The CP function may modify the following buffering instructions provided in a BAR as follows:
-	the Downlink Data Notification Delay in an PFCP Session Modification Request (for EPC); or
-	the Downlink Data Notification Delay (for EPC), DL Buffering Duration and/or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count in an PFCP Session Report Response message.
NOTE:	The CP function needs to provision a (possibly empty) BAR and associate it to the FARs of the PFCP session when establishing or modifying the PFCP session to be able to modify the BAR in an PFCP Session Report Response.
If the UP Function has indicated support of the feature UL/DL Buffering Control (UDBC), the CP function may provide the Suggested Buffering Packet Count IE in a BAR which is created during a PFCP Session Establishment procedure or a PFCP Session Modification procedure, and the CP function may modify it in a subsequent PFCP Session Modification Request, and/or a PFCP Session Report Response message. The same BAR may be associated with all the FARs in a PFCP session to indicate that all Service Data Flows in the PFCP Session share the same buffer in the UP function for the PFCP Session.
In this release of the specification, at most one BAR may be created per PFCP session.
5.2.4.2	Provisioning of Buffering Action Rule in the UP function
The CP function may provision the following buffering parameters in a BAR:
-	For EPC, the Downlink Data Notification Delay IE, to request the UP function to delay the sending of an PFCP Session Report Request, between receiving a downlink data packet and notifying the CP function about it, if the UP function indicated support of the Downlink Data Notification Delay parameter (see clause 8.2.28);
-	the DL Buffering Duration IE, to request the UP function to buffer the downlink data packet for an extended duration without sending any further notification to the CP function about the arrival of DL data packets, if the UP function indicated support of the DL Buffering Duration parameter (see clause 8.2.25);
-	the DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count, to request the UP function to buffer the suggested number of downlink data packets, when extended buffering of downlink data packet is required in the UP function.
-	the Suggested Buffering Packet Count IE if the UP Function has indicated support of the feature UDBC, to indicate the number of packets (including both uplink or downlink) that the CP function suggests to be buffered in the UP function, until it receives new instructions from the CP function, e.g. when the new Quota is granted.
The UP function shall stop applying the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count parameters and shall delete these parameters from the BAR (without explicit request from the CP function) when extended buffering of downlink data packets ends in the UP function.
NOTE:	The CP function will provide the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count parameters again when re-invoking extended buffering of downlink data packets.
The UP function shall stop applying buffering when new instruction is received from the CP function. The buffered packets shall be either dropped or forwarded following the packet forwarding model specified in clause 5.2.1 and taking into consideration that the buffered Packets have been already processed earlier.
5.2.5	QoS Enforcement Rule Handling 
5.2.5.1	General
The CP function shall provision QER(s) for an PFCP session in an PFCP Session Establishment Request or an PFCP Session Modification Request to request the UP function to perform QoS enforcement of the user plane traffic.
5.2.5.2	Provisioning of QoS Enforcement Rule in the UP function
The CP function may request the UP function to perform the following QoS enforcement actions in a QER:
-	Gating Control, as specified in clause 5.4.3;
-	QoS Control, i.e. MBR, GBR or Packet Rate enforcement, as specified in clause 5.4.4;
-	DL flow level marking for application detection, as specified in clause 5.4.5;
-	SCI (Service Class Indicator) marking for service identification for improved radio utilisation for GERAN, as specified in clause 5.4.12;
-	for 5GC reflective QoS for uplink traffic.
5.2.6	Combined SGW/PGW Architecture 
The usage of a combined SGW/PGW remains possible in a deployment with separated control and user planes, see clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. This is enabled by supporting a combined Sxa/Sxb interface with a common packet forwarding model, message and parameter structure for non-combined and combined cases.
The following additional requirements shall apply to a combined Sxa/Sxb interface between a combined SGW/PGW-C and a combined SGW/PGW-U:
-	all the functionalities specified for Sxa and Sxb shall be supported, possibly concurrently, over a combined Sxa/Sxb association;
-	a single PFCP session may be setup to support both the functionalities of an SGW-U and PGW-U;
-	the CP function may provision PDRs, QERs, URRs, FARs (possibly with a buffering instruction) and BAR, possibly concurrently, for the same PFCP session;
-	the CP function may provision concurrently parameters in a message or for the PFCP session that are applicable to Sxa and Sxb.
5.2.7	Multi-Access Rule Handling (for 5GC)
5.2.7.1	General
The UP function (i.e. the UPF) shall support the Multi-Access Rule (MAR) if it supports the ATSSS feature. 
The CP function (i.e. the SMF) shall provision one and only one MAR for every downlink PDR when the PDR is provisioned in a PFCP session if the PFCP session is established for a Multi-Access PDU session and if the UPF supports the ATSSS feature. 
The MAR provides instructions to the UP function on how to forward the packets matching the PDR over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. See clauses 5.8.2.11.8 and 5.32.8 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. 
In a MAR, the CP function (i.e. the SMF) shall: 
-	instruct the UPF which traffic steering functionality to use, i.e. MPTCP or ATSSS-LL, using the Steering Functionality IE; 
-	set the Steering Mode to instruct how the packets shall be distributed across 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, e.g. Active-Standby, Smallest Delay, Load Balancing and Priority Based;
-	provision access specific forwarding action information including:
-	a FAR ID which control the packets forwarding either to 3GPP access or non-3GPP access;
-	a Weight to indicate the proportion of traffic to be forwarded by the given FAR when the Steering Mode is set to "Load Sharing";
-	a Priority to indicate at which condition the traffic is to be forwarded by the given FAR when the Steering Mode is set to "Active-Standby" or "Priority-Based";
-	a list of URR IDs to enable the SMF to request separate usage report for different accesses;
The CP function may provision one or more MAR(s) (for different PDRs) per PFCP session. Different MARs of a same PFCP session may be provisioned with a different steering functionality together with a different steering mode, while different MARs of a same PFCP session may be associated with the same FAR(s). 
5.3	Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions
5.3.1	General
Forwarding of user plane data between the CP and UP functions may take place as part of the following scenarios (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] for EPC and 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] for 5GC).
Table 5.3.1-1: Data forwarding scenarios between the CP and UP functions

User plane packets shall be forwarded between the CP and UP functions by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation (see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
For forwarding data from the UP function to the CP function, the CP function shall provision PDR(s) per PFCP session context, with the PDI identifying the user plane traffic to forward to the CP function and with a FAR set with the Destination Interface "CP function side" and set to perform GTP-U encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function per PFCP session and PDR. The CP function shall then identify the PDN connection and the bearer to which the forwarded data belongs by the F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
For forwarding data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP function shall provision one or more PDR(s) per PFCP session context, with the PDI set with the Source Interface "CP function side" and identifying the GTP-u F-TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function per PDR, and with a FAR set to perform GTP-U decapsulation and to forward the packets to the intended destination. URRs and QERs may also be configured.
For EPC PFCP session contexts may correspond to individual PDN connections, TDF sessions, or standalone sessions not tied to any PDN connection or TDF session used e.g. for forwarding RADIUS, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the PGW-C and the PDN or for forwarding End Marker packets from the PGW-C or SGW-C to a downstream SGW-U or eNodeB.
For 5GC PFCP session contexts may correspond to individual PDU sessions or standalone sessions not tied to any PDU sessions used e.g. for forwarding RADIUS, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the SMF and the DN or for forwarding End Marker packets from the SMF to a downstream UPF or NG-RAN.
For EPC the CP function may establish one Sx-u tunnel per:
-	bearer of PDN connection e.g. for the data forwarding scenarios 1 and 3;
-	UP function or PDN e.g. for the data forwarding scenario 1, 2 and 4.
For 5GC the CP function may establish one N4-u tunnel per:
-	PDU session e.g. for the data forwarding scenarios 1, 3 and 5;
-	UP function or DN e.g. for the data forwarding scenario 1, 2 and 4.
Requirements for forwarding packets subject to buffering in the CP function between the UP and CP functions (scenario 3) are further specified in clause 5.3.3.
Requirements for sending End Marker packets (scenario 4) are further specified in clause 5.3.2.
Requirements for forwarding user data using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation between the UP and CP functions (scenario 5) are further specified in clause 5.3.5.
5.3.2	Sending of End Marker Packets 
The construction of End Marker packets may either be done in the CP function or UP function, based on network configuration, as specified in clause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] for EPC and in clause 5.8.2.9 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] for 5GC. The support of End Marker packets by the UP function is optional.
If the UP function indicated support of End Marker packets constructed in the UP function, the CP function shall request the UP function to construct and send End Marker packets by sending a Session Modification Request including FAR(s) with the new downstream F-TEID and with the SNDEM (Send End Marker Packets) flag set. 
For End Marker packets constructed in the CP function, the CP function shall:
-	establish (once) one standalone PFCP session not tied to any PDN connection, per the UP function, for forwarding End Marker packets, and provision the UP function to perform one GTP-U decapsulation and to forward the resulting packets without any further change towards the destination IP address of these packets;
-	construct the GTP-U End Marker packets, with the destination IP address and TEID set according to the old F-TEID value, and with a source IP address set according to the UP function's F-TEID value (e.g. S1 or Iu SGW F-TEID or NG-u UPF F-TEID);
-	encapsulate the constructed GTP-U End Marker packets in GTP-U packets according to the principles specified in clause 5.3.1 for data forwarding between the CP function and the UP function, and send them towards the F-TEID assigned in the UP function for the above PFCP session, after receipt of the PFCP Session Modification Response indicating that the UP function has switched to a new F-TEID.
Upon receipt of a PFCP Session Modification Request modifying the F-TEID in the Outer Header Creation of a FAR, the UP function shall send the Response message only after having switched to the new F-TEID.
5.3.3	Forwarding of Packets Subject to Buffering in the CP Function
5.3.3.1	General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 3 of Table 5.3.1-1 in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.
The CP function shall establish one Sx-u tunnel per bearer of a PDN connection / one N4-u tunnel per PDU session when applying the data forwarding scenario 3.
5.3.3.2	Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
For EPC, regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) for a combined SGW/PGW-U, or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) for a SGW-U, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the Sx-u tunnel corresponding to the bearer of the PDN connection. 
NOTE 1:	An SGW-U receiving G-PDUs from an S5/S8 bearer forwards the same G-PDUs towards the SGW-C but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header changed to the SGW-C IP address and TEID of the corresponding Sx-u tunnel.
For 5GC, regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) for an PSA-UPF, or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) for an I-UPF, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the N4-u tunnel corresponding to the PDU session of the PDN connection. 
NOTE 2:	An I-UPF receiving G-PDUs from an N9 GTPU tunnel forwards the same G-PDUs towards the SMF but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header changed to the SMF IP address and TEID of the corresponding N4-u tunnel.
To forward the user plane data to be buffered in the CP function from the UP function, the CP function shall provision:
-	for EPC, a PDR per bearer of the PDN connection, matching the received downlink user plane packets and for a (non-combined) SGW-U, with the field Outer Header Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to "0" or "1" for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively;
-	for 5GC, a PDR per PDU session, matching the received downlink user plane packets and for an I-UPF, with the field Outer Header Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to "0" or "1" for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively;
-	a FAR instructing the UP function to forward the received downlink data to the CP function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer Header Creation set to "0" or "1". 
NOTE 3:	The PDR can be provisioned in the UP function before applying data forwarding to the CP function.
For EPC, G-PDUs sent from the UP function to the CP function over the Sx-u tunnel shall include any GTP-U extension header(s):
-	possibly received by the UP function over the S5/S8 bearers and stored during the Outer Header Removal; 
-	possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule. 
For 5GC, G-PDUs sent from the UP function to the CP function over the N4-u tunnel shall include any GTP-U extension header(s):
-	possibly received by the UP function over the N9 PDU sessions and stored during the Outer Header Removal; 
-	possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule. 
5.3.3.3	Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function
Likewise, when subsequently sending the downlink traffic buffered in the CP function back to the UP function, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded:
-	for EPC, over Sx-u as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel set up for the corresponding bearer of the PDN connection.
-	for 5GC, over N4-u as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the N4-u tunnel set up for the corresponding PDU session.
G-PDUs sent over Sx-u / N4-u shall include GTP-U extension header(s) possibly received earlier from the UP function. 
To forward the user plane data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP function shall provision:
	a PDR per bearer of the PDN connection (for EPC) or per PDU session (for 5GC), with an IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u / N4-u tunnel, and with the field Outer Header Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to "0" or "1";
-	a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received downlink data from the CP function towards the RAN, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer Header Creation set to "0" or "1".
G-PDUs sent from the UP function towards the RAN shall include GTP-U extension header(s) possibly received from the CP function.
5.3.4	Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions with one PFCP-u Tunnel per UP Function or PDN
5.3.4.1	General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 1 and 2 of Table 5.3.1-1, when establishing one PFCP-u tunnel per UP function or PDN, in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.

5.3.4.2	Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the traffic received by the UP function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) from SGi / N6 or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) from the UE, the traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the PFCP-u tunnel corresponding to the UP function or PDN.
To forward the user plane data to from the UP function, the CP function shall provision:
-	for supporting data forwarding scenario "1" as specified in clause 5.3.1, an additional PDR for a PFCP session established for a PDN connection or a PDU session which requires such data forwarding, matching the received user plane packets from uplink direction. The Outer Header Removal IE shall not be present if the complete G-PDU is required to be forwarded, otherwise the Outer Header Removal IE shall be present and set to "0" or "1" for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively;
-	for supporting data forwarding scenario "2" as specified in clause 5.3.1, a PDR matching the received user plane packets from downlink direction; 
-	a FAR instructing the UP function to forward the received data to the CP function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer Header Creation set to "0" or "1" for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively, and the Outer GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the Sx-u tunnel. 
5.3.4.3	Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function
When sending user plane data from the CP function, the traffic shall be forwarded over PFCP-u as:
-	T-PDUs encapsulated in GTP-U with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the PFCP-u tunnel set up for the UP function or PDN or DN for traffic to be sent towards SGi or N6, or
-	G-PDUs encapsulated in GTP-U with the outer GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the PFCP-u tunnel set up for the UP function and with the inner GTP-U header set to the F-TEID assigned by the downstreams GTP-U peer (e.g. SGW, I-UPF) to the bearer over which the data shall be sent.

	a PDR per UP function, with an IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the PFCP-u tunnel, and with the field Outer Header Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to "0" or "1";
-	a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received data from the CP function.
5.3.5	Forwarding of user data using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (for 5GC)
5.3.5.1	General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 5 of Table 5.3.1-1 in addition to the requirements specified in clause 5.3.1.
The CP function shall establish one one N4-u tunnel per PDU session when applying the data forwarding scenario 5.
5.3.5.2	Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP function consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) from N6 or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) received from N9, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the N4-u tunnel corresponding to the PDU session. 
NOTE:	A UPF receiving G-PDUs from N9 forwards the G-PDUs towards the SMF but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header changed to the SMF IP address and TEID of the corresponding N4-u tunnel.
To forward the user plane data from the UP function to the CP function, the CP function shall provision:

-	possibly received by the UP function over the N9 interface and stored during the Outer Header Removal;
-	possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule. 
5.3.5.3	Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function

5.4	Policy and Charging Control
5.4.1	General
This clause describe how Policy and Charging Control requirements are supported over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points.
5.4.2	Service Detection and Bearer/QoS Flow Binding
Service detection refers to the process that identifies the packets belonging to a service data flow or application. For EPC, see clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.8.1 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. For 5GC, see clause 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44].
For EPC, bearer binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s) to an IP-CAN bearer deemed to transport the service data flow. UL bearer binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to no matching service data flow template for the uplink direction. See clauses 6.1.1.4 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. 
For 5GC, QoS flow binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s) to a QoS flow deemed to transport the service data flow. UL QoS flow binding verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to no matching QoS flow for the uplink direction. See clause 6.1.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
Service detection is controlled over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by configuring Packet Detection Information in PDRs to match the intended service data flows or application. 
For EPC, the mapping of DL traffic to bearers is achieved by configuring and associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to the appropriate downstream bearers (S5/S8 or S1/S12/S4/Iu).
For 5GC, the mapping of DL traffic to QoS flows is achieved by configuring QERs with QFI(s) for the QoS flow marking and associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to the appropriate downstream GTP-U tunnel (N9 or N3).
For EPC, uplink bearer binding verification is achieved by configuring Packet Detection Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer, the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming packet), and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets received on the uplink bearer but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or Application detection filter associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.
For 5GC, uplink QoS flow binding verification (see clause 5.7.1.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]) is achieved by configuring Packet Detection Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink PDU session, the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming packet), the QFI of the QoS flow and the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets received on the uplink PDU session but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or Application detection filter and QFI associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.
            NOTE 1:	For PCC Rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an application detection filter), uplink traffic can be received on other IP-CAN bearers than the one determined by the binding mechanism. The detection of the uplink part of the service data flow can be activated in parallel on other bearers with non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in addition to the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to. See clauses 6.1.1.1 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. Therefore the uplink PDRs for these bearers can be provisioned with the PDI containing this service data flow and the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
            NOTE 2:	To avoid the PGW-U discarding packets due to no matching service data flow template, the operator can apply open PCC rules (with wildcarded SDF filters) to allow for the passage of packets that do not match any other candidate SDF template. Therefore an uplink PDR can be provisioned with the PDI containing only the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
            NOTE 3:	Uplink bearer binding does not apply to Non-IP PDN connections.
            NOTE 4:	The UPF can be provisioned with a PDR (with low precedence) which contains the CN tunnel info, QFI and filter information that can detect any unwanted/unauthorized traffic with this QFI so that such traffic can be dropped with or without being counted before.
5.4.3	Gating Control
Gating control refers to the process within the user plane function (i.e. PGW-U and TDF-U for EPC, UPF for 5GC) of enabling or disabling the forwarding of IP packets, belonging to a service data flow or detected application's traffic, to pass through to the desired endpoint (for EPC see clause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and for 5GC see clause 4.3.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44]).
The PGW-C and TDF-C (for EPC) and the SMF (for 5GC) controls the gating in the PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and in the UPF (for 5GC) by creating PDR(s) for the service data flow(s) or application's traffic to be detected, and by associating a QER, including the Gate Status IE, to the PDRs.
The Gate Status IE indicates whether the service data flow or detected application traffic is allowed to be forwarded (the gate is open) or shall be discarded (the gate is closed) in the uplink and/or in downlink directions.
The PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and the UPF (for 5GC) shall identify UL and DL flows by the Source Interface IE in the PDI of the PDRs or the Destination Interface IE in the FARs. The PGW-U and TDF-U (for EPC) and the UPF (for 5GC) shall apply UL and DL gating accordingly.
5.4.4	QoS Control
QoS control refers to the authorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS that is authorized:
-	for EPC,
-	at the session level (APN-AMBR, TDF session UL and DL bitrates, or UL and DL Packet Rate of a PDN connection);
-	at the bearer level (GBR, MBR for GBR bearers);
-	at the service data flow (SDF) or application level.
-	for 5GC,
-	at the session level (Session-AMBR or UL and DL Packet Rate of a PDU session)
-	at the QoS Flow level;
-	at the service data flow (SDF) or application level.
See clause 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] clause 4.5.5 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and clause 4.7.7 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14].
The CP function shall control the QoS enforcement in the UP function by:
-	creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow, application, QoS Flow (for 5GC), bearer or session, if not already existing;
-	creating QERs for the QoS enforcement at session level, SDF/application level;
-	creating QERs for the QoS enforcement of the aggregate of SDFs with the same GBR QCI;
-	creating QERs for the QoS enforcement of the aggregate of SDFs with the same GBR QFI (for 5GC);
-	associating the session level QER to all the PDRs defined for the session;
-	associating the SDF or application QER to the PDRs associated to the SDF or application;
-	associating the QER of the aggregate of SDFs to the PDRs associated to SDFs or applications that share the QER.
The same QER may be associated to UL and DL PDRs. The UP function shall identify the UL and DL flows by the Source Interface IE in the PDRs or the Destination Interface IE in the FARs. The UP function shall enforce the QoS for the UL or DL flows accordingly.
The CP function shall map the precedence of a PCC rule to the precedence of the PDRs associated to the corresponding service data flows. 
5.4.5	DL Flow Level Marking for Application Detection
DL flow level marking is performed using DL DSCP marking. DL DSCP marking for application indication refers to the process in the TDF of marking detected downlink application traffic with a DSCP value received within an installed ADC rule matching this traffic. See Annex U of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.2.7 and 4b.5.14 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
DL DSCP marking for application indication is controlled by the TDF-C by associating a QER, including the ToS or Traffic Class within the DL Flow Level Marking IE, to the PDR matching the DL traffic to be marked. The TDF-U performs the DL DSCP marking for the detected DL traffic and sends the marked packet to the PGW-U.
If a tunnelling protocol is used between the TDF-U and the PGW-U, the DSCP value for service data flow detection shall be carried in the inner IP header.
The TDF-C may stop the DL DSCP marking for the application during the PFCP session by removing the related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE from the related QER, the TDF-U shall then stop such function consequently.
Policy and charging control in the downlink direction by the PCEF for an application detected by the TDF is performed by the PGW-C configuring a PDR with a PDI containing an SDF Filter with the corresponding DSCP value.
5.4.6	Usage Monitoring
Usage Monitoring Control refers to the process of monitoring the user plane traffic in the PGW-U, TDF-U or UPF for the accumulated usage of network resources per:
-	individual or group of service data flows;
-	individual or group of applications;
-	PDU session, possibly excluding an individual SDF or a group of service data flow(s) (for 5GC);
-	IP-CAN session, possibly excluding an individual SDF or a group of service data flow(s) (for EPC), and/or
-	TDF session, possibly excluding an individual application or a group of application(s) (for EPC).
For EPC, see clauses 4.4, 6.2.2.3 and 6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.16, 4.5.17, 4b.5.6, 4b.5.7 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For 5GC, see clauses 4.3.4 and 6.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clauses 4.2.2.10, 4.2.3.11, 4.2.4.10, 4.2.6.2.5, 4.2.6.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [41].
Usage Monitoring Control is supported over the Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by activating in the UP function the reporting of usage information towards the CP function, as specified in clauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] and in clause 5.8.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. 
The CP function shall control the Usage Reporting in the UP function by: 
-	creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow, application or session; 
-	creating a URR for each Monitoring key; and
-	associating the URR to:
-	all the PDRs of the PFCP session, for usage monitoring at IP-CAN or TDF session level, possibly excluding the PDRs matching the SDFs or Applications excluded from the usage monitoring at session level; or
-	the PDR(s) of the PFCP session associated to the individual or group of SDF(s) or Application(s), for usage monitoring at SDF or application level.
5.4.7	Traffic Redirection
Traffic Redirection refers to the process of redirecting uplink application traffic, in a PGW, TDF or UPF, towards a redirect destination, e.g. redirect some HTTP flows to a service provisioning page. For EPC, see clause 6.1.13 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.2.6 and 4b.5.1.4 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For 5GC, see clause 6.1.3.12 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and clause 4.2.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [46].
The redirect destination may be provided by the PCRF/PCF or be preconfigured in the CP function or in the UP function.
For EPC, the traffic redirection may be enforced in the CP function or in the UP function. For 5GC, the traffic redirection may be enforced in the UP function only. If the traffic that the UP function can support may be subject to traffic redirection, traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function shall be supported by the UP function. The UP function reports to the CP function whether it supports traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function via the UP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.25).
NOTE:	A UP function that supports traffic not requiring traffic redirection does not need to support traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function. The CP function can select a UP function supporting traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function for users or services which may require traffic redirection.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the CP function, the CP function shall instruct the UP function to forward the applicable user traffic to the CP function, as specified in clause 5.3.1.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the UP function, the CP function shall:
-	create the necessary PDR(s) to represent the traffic to be redirected, if not already existing;
-	create a FAR with:
-	the Redirect Information IE including the redirect destination, if the traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination provided by the CP function; a redirect destination provided by the CP function shall prevail over a redirect destination preconfigured in the UP function; ;
-	For HTTP traffic redirection, the Redirection Address Type shall be set to "URL" and the CP function shall set the Destination Interface IE in the FAR to "Access" (to forward the HTTP response message with a status code indicating redirect). For other types of traffic redirection, the Destination Interface IE in the FAR may be set to "Core". 
or
-	the Forwarding Policy IE including the identifier of the forwarding policy to apply, if the traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination preconfigured in the UP function;
-	associate the FAR to the above PDRs of the PFCP session.
5.4.8	Traffic Steering
Traffic Steering refers to the process of applying a specific (S)Gi-LAN traffic steering policy in the PCEF or TDF (or TSSF), or a specific N6-LAN traffic steering policy in the UPF (PDU Session Anchor), for the purpose of steering the subscriber's traffic to appropriate operator or 3rd party service functions (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS protection) in the (S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN, per service data flows level or applications level.
Application Function influencing traffic routing (see clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]) also uses traffic steering for the purpose of steering the subscriber's traffic over N6, e.g. to a local access to a Data Network.    
The UP function shall set the TRST feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports Traffic Steering (see clause 8.2.25).
Traffic Steering is supported over the Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points by instructing the UP function to apply a specific Forwarding Policy, that is locally configured in the UP function and that can be used for the uplink, the downlink or for both directions. A Forwarding Policy is identified by a Forwarding Policy Identifier. Traffic steering is alternatively supported over the N4 reference point by instructing the UP function to route packets according to N6 routing information in the FAR (e.g. providing an IP address in the Outer Header Creation).  
When so instructed, the UP function shall perform the necessary actions to enforce the forwarding policy referenced by the CP function, e.g. performing packet marking and routing the traffic towards the service functions within the (S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN.
See 3GPP TS 23.203 [7], 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The CP function shall control Traffic Steering towards SGi-LAN, N6-LAN or N6 in the UP function by:
-	creating the necessary PDRs to represent the service data flows or applications to be steered;
-	creating a FAR with the Forwarding Policy IE including the Forwarding Policy Identifier set to the Traffic Steering Policy Identifier, or creating a FAR with a Outer Header Creation with the destination IP address; and
-	associating the FAR to the above PDRs of the PFCP session.
The CP function shall control the processing of the traffic received from the (S)Gi-LAN or N6-LAN in the UP function as specified in the rest of this specification for traffic received from any other interface, but with PDR(s) including a PDI with the Source Interface indicating "SGi-LAN/N6-LAN". The UP function shall distinguish packets coming from (S)Gi-LAN/N6-LAN based on local configuration.
5.4.9	Provisioning of Predefined PCC/ADC Rules
A Predefined PCC rule is preconfigured in the PCEF, e.g. a PGW (for EPC) or SMF (for 5GC). Predefined PCC rules can be activated or deactivated by the PCRF/PCF at any time. The Predefined PCC rules may be grouped allowing the PCRF/PCF to dynamically activate a set of PCC rules.
For EPC a predefined ADC rule is preconfigured in the TDF. In the case of solicited reporting, the Predefined ADC rules can be activated or deactivated by the PCRF at any time. Predefined ADC rules within the TDF may be grouped allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of ADC rules.
For the definition of PCC and ADC rules see clauses 4.3.1 and 4b.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and clause 5.6.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [41].
The CP function may enforce an activated predefined PCC or ADC rule by the PCRF/PCF in the UP function by:
-	determining the service data filters or application IDs referred by the activated predefined PCC or ADC rule(s) and the corresponding QoS and charging control information respectively;
-	creating the necessary PDR(s) to identify the service data flow(s), application(s) that the predefined PCC or ADC rule refer to, if not already existing; 
-	creating the necessary QER for the QoS enforcement at service data flow or application level accordingly;
-	creating the necessary FAR if a new FAR needs to be created as result of Bearer binding (for EPC) or QoS flow binding (for 5GC) and QoS control for forwarding the detected service data flow or application traffic, or to redirect or to apply traffic steering control if included in the predefined PCC/ADC rule;
-	creating the necessary URR(s) for each monitoring key, charging key, combination of Charging Key and Service ID, or combination of Charging Key, Sponsor ID and Application Service Provider Id if included in the predefined PCC or ADC rule; 
And then:
-	associating the created URR(s) to the newly created PDR(s);
-	associating the existing FAR or the new FAR to the newly created PDR(s);
Optionally, the traffic handling policies common to many PFCP sessions (i.e. predefined PDR(s) / QER(s) / FAR(s) / URR(s)) may be configured in the UP function. The CP function may activate these traffic handling policies by including the Activate Predefined Rules IE within:
-	the Create PDR IE in an PFCP Session Establishment Request; or
-	the Update PDR IE in an PFCP Session Modification Request.
For traffic matching PDR(s) associated with the activated predefined rules, the UP function shall enforce the rules, e.g. for URR, the UP function shall generate Usage Report(s) and send it to the CP function and the CP function shall be able to handle the usage reports as described in clause 5.2.2.
NOTE:	The URR IDs used in reports triggered by a predefined rule in UP function are also pre-configured at the CP function.
For deactivating predefined rules which are activated in the UP function, the CP function shall include the Deactivate Predefined Rules IE in the Update PDR IE in an PFCP Session Modification Request to inform the UP function to deactivate the corresponding predefined rules for the related PDR.
5.4.10	Charging
For EPC, the charging requirements for online and offline charging in the PS domain specified in 3GPP TS 32.251 [17] shall be preserved with a split SGW, PGW and TDF architecture.
For 5GC, the charging requirements for online and offline charging in the 5G data connectivity domain are specified in 3GPP TS 32.255 [45].
Charging is supported by the CP function by activating in the UP function the measurement and reporting of the accumulated usage of network resources per:
-	for EPC:
-	IP-CAN bearer, for an SGW;
-	IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session and/or individual or group of service data flows, for a PGW;
-	TDF session and/or individual or group of applications, for a TDF;
-	for 5GC:
-	PDU session and/or individual or group of service data flows, for an SMF
-	QoS Flow, for an SMF.
See clauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The CP function shall control the usage measurement and reporting in the UP function by:
-	creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow, application, bearer or session, if not already existing;
-	creating URR(s) for each Charging Key, combination of Charging Key and Service ID, or combination of Charging Key, Sponsor ID and Application Service Provider Id;
-	associating the URR(s) to the relevant PDRs defined for the PFCP session, for usage reporting at IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session, TDF session, SDF or application level.
For online charging, the CP function shall provision the URR with the Volume (or Time) Quota, and with the Volume (or Time) Quota if a quota threshold was received from the OCS, as specified in clause 5.2.2.2. Besides, when the OCS provides a final quota and requests to redirect the traffic towards a redirect destination when exhausing this quota, the CP function shall redirect the traffic towards a redirect destination as specified in clause 5.4.7 upon being notified that the final quota has been reached; to permit HTTP traffic redirection, the UP function should have at least one HTTP packet, e.g. the UP function may store one packet when reaching the Volume (or Time) Quota. An example call flow is depicted in Annex C.2.1.1.
To avoid the risk of signalling storms between the CP and UP functions at times of tariff change, the CP function may include the Monitoring Time IE and zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs in the URR and set it to the time of tariff change to request the UP function to report separately the resource usage before and after the time of tariff change (see e.g. clause 6.3.7.1 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]).
5.4.11	(Un)solicited Application Reporting
For EPC, (un)solicited Application Reporting refers to the process of reporting the start or stop of applications by the TDF or PCEF. See 3GPP TS 23.203 [3] and 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For 5GC, solicited Application Reporting refers to the process of reporting the start or stop of applications by the SMF to the PCF. See 3GPP TS 23.503 [44] and 3GPP TS 29.512 [41]. Unsolicited application reporting is not applicable for 5GC.
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to detect and report applications by:
-	creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the applications to detect;
-	creating a URR with the Reporting Trigger IE set to detect the start and/or stop of Traffic;
-	associating the URR to the PDR.
For unsolicited application reporting, an PFCP session which is not linked to any specific TDF session may be established and the PDI in the PDR(s) does not contain any UE IP address.
When detecting the start or stop of an application, the UP function shall then initiate the PFCP Session Report procedure and send a Usage Report with the Usage Report Trigger set to 'Start of Traffic' or 'Stop of Traffic'. The UP function shall also include the following information in the Usage Report:
-	when reporting the start of an application:
-	the Application ID;
-	the Flow Information including the Flow Description and the Flow Direction, if the traffic flow information is deducible;
-	the Application-Instance-Identifier, if the traffic flow information is deducible; and
-	if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE's IP address, and the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used in the UP function.
NOTE:	When the CP function instructs the UP function to perform unsolicited application reporting, the PDI in the corresponding PDR has no UE IP address.
-	when reporting the stop of an application:
-	the Application ID;
-	the Application-Instance-Identifier, if an Application Identifier was provided when reporting the start of the application;
-	if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE's IP address, and the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used in the UP function.
The UP function shall only report the Application ID when detecting the start or stop of an application and the Reduced Application Detection Information flag is set in the Measurement Information of the URR, e.g. for envelope reporting.
5.4.12	Service Identification for Improved Radio Utilisation for GERAN
Service Identification for improved radio utilization for GERAN refers to the process in the PGW of marking DL user plane traffic with a Service Class Indicator (SCI) value. See clause 5.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [19].
This is controlled by the PGW-C by associating a QER, including the Service Class Indicator within the DL Flow Level Marking IE, to the PDR matching the DL traffic to be marked. The PGW-U performs the SCI marking for the detected DL traffic and sends the packet with the GTP-U Service Class Indicator Extension Header downstreams.
The PGW-C may stop the SCI marking during the PFCP session by removing the related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE from the related QER, the PGW-U shall then stop such function consequently.
5.4.13	Transport Level Marking 
For EPC, transport level marking is performed on a per EPS bearer basis in the SGW and PGW. Transport level marking refers to the process of marking traffic with a DSCP value based on the locally configured mapping from the QCI and optionally the ARP priority level.
For 5GC, transport level marking is performed on a per QoS flow basis. Transport level marking refers to the process of marking traffic at the UPF with a DSCP value based on the mapping from the 5QI, the Priority Level (if explicitly signalled) and optionally the ARP priority level configured at the SMF.
Transport level marking shall be controlled by the CP function by providing the DSCP in the ToS or Traffic Class within the Transport Level Marking IE in the FAR that is associated to the PDR matching the traffic to be marked. The UP function shall perform the transport level marking for the detected traffic and sends the marked packet to the peer entity.
The CP function may change transport level marking by changing the Transport Level Marking IE in the related FAR.
5.4.14	Deferred PDR activation and deactivation
As specified in clause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and clauses 4.5.13 and 4a.5.13 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], Policy and charging control rule operations can be also performed in a deferred mode. To support such deferred PCC rule activation or deactivation, the CP function and UP function may optionally support the Deferred PDR activation and deactivation (DPDRA) as described below.
If the feature DPDRA is supported in both CP function and UP function, and when a PCC rule is provisioned in a deferred mode, i.e. with a Rule-Activation-Time and/or Rule-Deactivation-Time, the CP function shall provision the corresponding PDR using Create PDR IE or Update PDR together with an Activation Time and/or Deactivation Time to enable the PDR being activated or deactivated at requested time. 
Without being provisioned together with an Activation Time or a Deactivation Time, a PDR shall be active immediately when it is received. When the status of a PDR is changed from active to inactive, the UP function shall keep storing the inactive PDR together with its associated FAR, URR(s) and QER(s), and then UP function shall apply the same behavior as if the PDR is deleted.
The CP function shall control at what time the status of a PDR rule changes using Activation Time and/or Deactivation Time as exactly as being instructed by the PCRF using a Rule-Activation-Time and/or Rule-Deactivation-Time, as specified in clause 4.5.13 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
1)	If only Activation Time is specified and has not yet occurred, then the UP function shall set the PDR rule inactive and make it active at that time. If Activation Time has passed, then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR rule active.
2)	If only Deactivation Time is specified and has not yet occurred, then the UP function shall set the PDR rule active and make it inactive at that time. If Deactivation Time has passed, then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR rule inactive.
3)	If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified, and the Activation Time occurs before the Deactivation Time, and also when the PDR rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Deactivation Time, the UP function shall handle the rule as defined in 1) and then as defined in 2).
4)	If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified, and the Deactivation Time occurs before the Activation Time, and also when the PDR rule is provided before or at the time specified in the Activation Time, the UP function shall handle the rule as defined in 2) and then as defined in 1).
5)	If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified but time has already occurred for both, and the Activation Time occurs before the Deactivation Time, then the UP function shall immediately set the PDR rule inactive. 
NOTE 1:	If the CP function receives both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time from the PCRF, but time has already occurred for both, and the Rule-Activation-Time occurs before the Rule-Deactivation-Time, as alternative to above, the CP function can deactivate the corresponding PDR rule by provisioning a Deactivation Time which has occurred or removing the corresponding PDR rule. 
6)	If both Activation Time and Deactivation Time are specified but time has passed for both, and the Deactivation Time occurs before the Activation Time, then the UP fucntion shall immediately set the PDR rule active. 
NOTE 2:	If the CP function receives both Rule-Activation-Time and Rule-Deactivation-Time from the PCRF, but time has passed for both, and the Rule-Deactivation-Time occurs before the Rule-Activation-Time, as alternative to above, the CP function can activate the corresponding PDR rule by provisioning a activation Time which has occurred, or update the PDR without providing Activation Time and Deactivation Time, or create the corresponding PDR rule if the PDR is not provisioned yet.
5.5	F-TEID Allocation and Release 
5.5.1	General
F-TEID shall be allocated either by the CP function or the UP function. The support of F-TEID allocation by the CP function is mandatory. The support of F-TEID allocation by the UP function is optional. See clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The UP function shall set the FTUP feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports F-TEID allocation in the UP function (see clause 8.2.25). If so, the CP function shall determine whether F-TEIDs are allocated by the CP function or the UP function based on network configuration. The same F-TEID allocation option shall be used by all the CP functions controlling a particular UP function. The UP function shall reject a request to establish a new PDR with a different F-TEID allocation option than the option used for already created PDRs (by the same or a different CP function), with the cause "Invalid F-TEID allocation option".
5.5.2	F-TEID allocation in the CP function
When performing F-TEID allocation in the CP function, the CP function shall assign the Local F-TEID IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1) and provide the assigned F-TEID value to the UP function.
5.5.3	F-TEID allocation in the UP function
When performing F-TEID allocation in the UP function, the CP function shall request the UP function to allocate the F-TEID by setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1). The Source Interface IE indicates for which interface the F-TEID is to be assigned. 
The CP function may request the UP function to allocate the same F-TEID to several PDRs to be created within one single PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request by: 
-	setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of each PDR to be created with a new F-TEID, and 
-	setting the CHOOSE ID field of the Local F-TEID IE, for each PDR to be created with the same F-TEID, with the same CHOOSE ID value. 
or, if the UP function indicated support of the PDI optimization (see clause 8.2.25), by:
-	including the Local F-TEID IE only in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE and by setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of this IE; and
-	including the Traffic Endpoint ID in all the PDRs to be created with the same F-TEID.
If the PDR(s) is created successfully, the UP function shall return the F-TEID(s) it has assigned to the PDR(s) or to the Traffic Endpoint(s) in the PFCP Session Establishment Response or PFCP Session Modification Response. 
Upon receiving a request to remove a PDR or a Traffic Endpoint, or to delete an PFCP session, the UP function shall free the F-TEID(s) that was assigned to the PDR if there is no more PDR with the same F-TEID, to the Traffic Endpoint or to the PFCP Session.
5.6	PFCP Session Handling
5.6.1	General
The following clauses provide details on PFCP Sessions handling.
5.6.2	Session Endpoint Identifier Handling
The SEID uniquely identifies an PFCP session at an IP address of a PFCP entity. The F-SEID is the Fully Qualified SEID and it contains the SEID and IP address. The PFCP endpoint locally assigns the SEID value the peer PFCP side has to use when transmitting message. The SEID values are exchanged between PFCP endpoints using PFCP messages. The PFCP entity communicates to the peer PFCP entity the SEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent control plane messages related to that PFCP session via the "F-SEID" IE. 
The PFCP session related messages shall share the same F-SEID for the PFCP session. A F-SEID shall be released after the PFCP session is released.
5.6.3	Modifying the Rules of an Existing PFCP Session
The following principles shall apply, unless specified otherwise in the specification.
When modifying an existing PFCP session, the CP function shall only provide in the PFCP Request message the requested changes compared to what was previously provisioned in the UP function for this PFCP session, i.e. the CP function shall:
-	include IEs which needs to be newly provisioned in the UP function;
-	include IEs which need to be provisioned with a modified value;
-	remove IEs which need to be removed from the set of parameters previously provisioned in the UP function, as further specified below.
The CP function shall remove IEs which needs to be removed by either:
-	removing the entire Rule if no other parameter of that rule needs to remain provisioned in the UP function, e.g. by including the Remove URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request; or
-	updating the Rule including the IEs to be removed with a null length, e.g. by including the Update URR IE in the PFCP Session Modification Request with the IE(s) to be removed with a null length.
The CP function shall set a URR ID and/or QER ID with a length "0" in the Update PDR IE within PFCP Session Modification Request, to request the UP function to stop applying the URRs and/or QERs for this PDR.
Upon receipt of an PFCP Request which modifies an existing PFCP session, the UP function shall add, update or remove the parameters as instructed by the CP function, as defined above, and shall keep unchanged the set of parameters previously provisioned in the UP function which are neither modified nor removed.
5.7	Support of Lawful Interception
5.7.1	General
This clause specifies lawful interception with PFCP in EPC.
5.7.2	Lawful Interception in EPC
Requirements for support of Lawful Interception with a split SGW or PGW are specified in clauses 12.9 and 20.4 of 3GPP TS 33.107 [20].
User plane packets shall be forwarded from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation (see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to duplicate the packets to be intercepted and to forward them to the SX3LIF (or to the LMISF for S8HR) as specified in clause 5.2.3.
For forwarding data from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR), the CP function shall set the DUPL flag in the Apply Action and set the Duplicating Parameters in the FAR, associated to the PDRs of the traffic to be intercepted, with the Destination Interface "LI Function" and set to perform GTP-U encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely assigned in the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) for the traffic to be intercepted. The SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) shall then identify the intercepted traffic by the F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
5.7.3	Lawful Interception in 5GC
Requirements for support of Lawful Interception with SMF and UPF are specified in clauses 6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 33.127 [47]. The PFCP protocol is not used for Lawful Interception in 5GC. 
5.8	PFCP Association 
5.8.1	General
An PFCP Association shall be set up between the CP function and the UP function prior to establishing PFCP sessions on that UP function. Only one PFCP association shall be setup between a given pair of CP and UP functions, even if the CP and/or UP function exposes multiple IP addresses. A single PFCP association may also be setup between a SMF set and a UPF (see clause 5.22).
The CP function and the UP function shall support the PFCP Association Setup procedure initiated by the CP function (see clause 6.2.6.2). The CP function and the UP function may additionally support the PFCP Association Setup procedure initiated by the UP function (see clause 6.2.6.3).
A CP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple UP functions. A UP function may have PFCP Associations set up with multiple CP functions.
A CP function or a UP function shall be identified by a unique Node ID. A Node ID may be set to an FQDN or an IP address (see clause 8.2.38).
Prior to establishing an PFCP Association, the function responsible for establishing the PFCP Association (e.g. CP function) shall look up a peer function (e.g. UP function), e.g using DNS procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]), NRF procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [43]) or local configuration. If the peer function is found to support multiple IP addresses (in the look up information), one of these addresses (any one) shall be used as destination IP address to send the PFCP Association Setup Request. Once the PFCP Association is established, any of the IP addresses of the peer function (found during the look-up) may then be used to send subsequent PFCP node related messages and PFCP session establishment requests for that PFCP Association.  
NOTE 1:	The look up information (e.g. in DNS, NRF or local configuration of the function responsible for establishing the PFCP association) needs to be configured consistently with the addressing information of the peer function. If a FQDN is configured to identify a function in DNS or NRF, then the Node ID of that function included in PFCP messages need to be set to the same FQDN. For instance, if the CP function is responsible for establishing the PFCP association, a UP function that exposes multiple IP addresses (for PFCP node related messages and PFCP session establishment requests) needs to be configured in the look up information as one (single) UP function that is associated to multiple IP addresses. The Node ID needs to be set to an SMF set FQDN when a single association is setup between an SMF set and UPF (see clause 5.22).
NOTE 2:	PFCP session related messages for sessions that are already established are sent to the IP address received in the F-SEID allocated by the peer function or to the IP address of an alternative SMF in the SMF set (see clause 5.22). The former IP address needs not be configured in the look up information. See clause 4.3.2 and 4.3.3. 
5.8.2	Behaviour with an Established PFCP Association
When an PFCP Association is established with a UP function, the CP function:
-	shall provision node related parameters (i.e. parameters that apply to all PFCP sessions) in the UP function, if any, e.g. PFDs;
-	shall provision the UP function with the list of features (affecting the UP function behaviour) the CP function supports, if any, e.g. support of load and/or overload control;
-	shall check the responsiveness of the UP function using the Heartbeat procedure as specified in clause 6.2.2;
-	may establish PFCP sessions on that UP function; 
-	shall refrain from attempting to establish new PFCP sessions on the UP function, if the UP function has indicated it will shut down gracefully.
When an PFCP Association is established with a CP function, the UP function:
-	shall update the CP function with the list of features it supports;
-	shall update the CP function with its load and/or overload control information, if load and/or overload control is supported by the CP and UP functions;
-	may update the CP function with the set of its IP resources available for use by the CP function, when F-TEID allocation is performed by the CP function;
NOTE:	The CP function can be aware of the available IP resources in the UP function e.g. based on the UP function reporting this information over Sx using Sx node related messages, or by other implementation specific means.
-	shall accept PFCP Session related messages from that CP function (unless prevented by other reasons, e.g. overload);
-	shall check the responsiveness of the CP function using the Heartbeat procedure as specified in clause 6.2.2;
-	shall indicate to the CP function if it will shut down within a graceful period and, when possible, if it fails and becomes out of service.
5.8.3	Behaviour without an Established PFCP Association
When an PFCP Association is not established with a UP function, the CP function:
-	shall reject any incoming PFCP Session related messages from that UP function, with a cause indicating that no PFCP association exists with the peer entity.
When an PFCP Association is not yet established with a CP function, the UP function:
-	shall reject any incoming PFCP Session related messages from that CP function, with a cause indicating that no PFCP association exists with the peer entity.
5.9	Usage of Vendor-specific IE
Vendor-specific IEs are defined to cover requirements and features not specified by 3GPP.
NOTE 1:	When a IE is intended to be used by more than one vendor, the definition of the IE is encouraged to be specified by 3GPP to ease implementation and interoperability.
NOTE 2:	The PFCP entities can use Vendor-specific IE(s) in the PFCP message relevant to the PFCP Association Setup procedure to learn which vendor specific enhancements are supported by the peer.
In a network with Vendor specific enhancements, unrecognized vendor specific IEs shall be handled as unknown optional IEs.
5.10	Error Indication Handling
Upon receipt of a GTP-U Error Indication message, the UP function:
-	shall identify the related PFCP session for which the message is received; and
-	shall initiate an PFCP Session Report procedure, towards the CP function controlling this PFCP session, to send an Error Indication Report including the remote F-TEID signalled in the GTP-U Peer Address IE and the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I IE of the GTP-U Error Indication (see clause 7.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
For EPC, upon receipt of an Error Indication Report, the CP function shall then identify the bearer for which the Error Indication Report is received using the remote F-TEID included in the report and proceed as specified in clauses 21.7 and 21.8 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24], i.e.:
-	modify the PFCP session to instruct the UP function to buffer DL packets;
-	modify the PFCP session to delete the PDR and FAR, when having to delete a bearer; or
-	delete the PFCP session, when having to delete the PDN connection.
For 5GC, upon receipt of an Error Indication Report, the SMF shall proceed as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [40].
5.11	User plane inactivity detection and reporting
Clause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] requires the PGW to initiate the release of an inactive emergency PDN connection. 
Clause 4.3.7 and 4.3.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [29] requires the SMF to be able to initiate the deactivation of the UP connection of an existing PDU session without user plane activity for a given inactivity period, except for the H-SMF for the home routed roaming scenario or except for an always-on PDU session as described in clause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The CP function may request the UP function to detect and report when no user plane packets are received for an PFCP session, by provisioning the User Plane Inactivity Timer IE in the PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request. 
Upon being provisioned with this IE, the UP function shall monitor the user plane activity of the PFCP session, and report any user plane inactivity exceeding the duration indicated by this IE by sending an PFCP Session Report Request with the Report Type set to UPIR (User Plane Inactivity Report). The UP function shall then continue to process any further user plane packets as instructed by the rules provisioned for the PFCP session, until receiving any new instruction from the CP function.
5.12	Suspend and Resume Notification procedures
Upon receipt of a Suspend Notification message, the PGW-C should request the PGW-U to discard packets received for the suspended PDN connection by:
-	setting the DROP flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the corresponding PFCP session, or 
-	setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value CLOSED.
Upon being requested to resume the PDN connection, the PGW-C should re-allow the PGW-U to forward the packets for the PDN connection (unless not permitted for other reasons) by:
-	setting the FORW flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the corresponding PFCP session or 
-	setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value OPEN.
5.13	Ethernet traffic (for 5GC)
5.13.1	General
An SMF and UPF may support Ethernet PDU sessions, as specified in clause 5.6.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501[28].
For a PFCP session set up for an Ethernet PDU session, the SMF shall:
-	include the PDN Type IE set to "Ethernet" in the PFCP Session Establishment Request;
-	provision PDR(s), for uplink and/or downlink traffic, with Ethernet Packet Filter(s), based on at least any combination of:
-	Source/destination MAC address;  
-	Ethertype as defined in IEEE 802.3 [31]; 
-	Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) VID fields as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [30];  
-	Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) PCP/DEI fields as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [30]; 
-	IP Packet Filter Set, in case Ethertype indicates IPv4/IPv6 payload. ; 
-	Ethernet PDU Session Information, only possible for a DL PDR, that identifies all (DL) Ethernet packets matching the PDU session as follows, based on the N6 Ethernet configuration in the UPF for the associated Network Instance (see clause 5.6.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]): 
-	DL traffic based on the MAC address(es) and/or C-TAG and/or S-TAG used by the UE for the UL traffic, for configurations where more than one PDU Session to the same DNN (e.g. for more than one UE) corresponds to the same N6 interface; 
-	DL traffic from the N6 interface associated to the PDU session, for configurations where there is a one-to-one relationship between a PDU Session and a N6 interface (in which case the UPF does not need to be aware of MAC addresses and/or C-TAG and/or S-TAG used by the UE in order to route down-link traffic). 
NOTE 1:	For instance, the SMF can provision a DL PDR with just an "Ethernet PDU Session Information", in a Traffic Endpoint ID or in a PDI, or Ethernet Packet Filters in a PDI, or both an "Ethernet PDU Session Information" in a Traffic Endpoint ID and Ethernet Packet Filters in a PDI.  
The SMF may also request a UPF, acting as a PDU session anchor, to: 
-	redirect Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation traffic (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) to the SMF as specified in clause 5.13.2, or to respond to ARP or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation based on the local cache information as specified in clause 5.13.3; 
-	report the MAC (Ethernet) addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by the UE, as specified in clause 5.13.5.
For a PFCP session set up for an Ethernet PDU session, the UPF shall:
-	detect Ethernet traffic, based on Ethernet Packet Filter(s) provisioned in PDR(s) by the SMF, and process the Ethernet traffic as instructed in the FAR, QER(s) and URR(s) associated to the PDR(s);
-	forward Address Resolution Protocol (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation messages (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) to the SMF, as specified in clause 5.13.2, if so required by the SMF.
-	respond to Address Resolution Protocol (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) based on the local cache information, as specified in clause 5.13.3, if so required by the SMF; 
NOTE 2:	Ethernet Preamble and Start of Frame delimiter are not sent over 5GS. 
NOTE 3:	How the UPF/SMF builds the ARP or the IPv6 Neighbour cache is not specified in this release and is implementation specific.
5.13.2	Address Resolution Protocol or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Response by SMF
If the SMF requests the UPF to forward all Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) traffic to the SMF to respond to the ARP or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation based on the local cache information for Ethernet PDU sessions, the SMF shall provision a PDR in the UPF with:
-	an Ethernet Packet Filter containing EtherType 2054 (hexadecimal 0x0806) and associate the PDR with a FAR, for forwarding ARP traffic to the SMF; and/or
-	a PDI containing an application ID such that the identified application ID matches against EtherType 34525 (hexadecimal 0x86DD), IPv6 Next Header type as 58 and ICMP Field Type as 135 and associate the PDR with a FAR, for forwarding IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation traffic to the SMF.
In this case, the user plane packets shall be forwarded between the CP and UP functions by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation (see clause 5.3.1).
The SMF shall respond to ARP  and/or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], clause 5.6.10.2 in this case.
5.13.3	Address Resolution Protocol or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Response by UPF
If the SMF requests the UPF to respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) (see IETF RFC 826 [32]) or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation (see IETF RFC 4861 [33]) based on the local cache information for an Ethernet PDU session, the SMF shall provision a PDR in the UPF with:
-	an Ethernet Packet Filter containing EtherType 2054 (hexadecimal 0x0806) and associate the PDR with a FAR that has the ARP bit in Proxying IE of the Forwarding Parameters IE set to 1; or
-	a PDI containing an application ID such that the identified application ID matches against EtherType 34525 (hexadecimal 0x86DD), IPv6 Next Header type as 58 and ICMP Field Type as 135 and associate the PDR with a FAR that has the INS bit in Proxying IE of the Forwarding Parameters IE set to 1.
The UPF shall respond to ARP and/or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], clause 5.6.10.2 in this case.
5.13.3A	Provisioning of MAC addresses and SDF filters in Ethernet Packet Filters
The provisioning of an SDF Filter in an Ethernet Packet Filter shall follow the requirements specified for provisioning an SDF Filter in clause 5.2.1A.2A. 
Likewise, the source and destination MAC addresses information, when provisioned, shall be set as for downlink Ethernet flows. The UP function shall apply source and destination MAC addresses information based on the Source Interface of the PDR, according to the same principles as specified in clause 5.2.1A.2A, e.g. swapping the source and destination MAC addresses information if the Source Interface is ACCESS, and applying them as provisioned if the Source Interface is CORE.
5.13.4	Bidirectional Ethernet Filters
The CP function may provision bidirectional Ethernet Filters in the UP function (see clause 7.5.2.2-x), i.e. Ethernet filters that may be associated to both uplink and downlink PDRs of a same PFCP session, as follows:
-	when provisioning a bidirectional Ethernet Filter the first time for an PFCP session, the CP function shall set the BIDE (Bidirectional Ethernet Filter) flag in the Ethernet Filter Properties IE and provision the Ethernet filter definition together with a Ethernet Filter ID uniquely identifying the Ethernet Filter among all the Ethernet Filters provisioned for a given PFCP session; the source and destination MAC addresses information, in a bidirectional Ethernet filter, shall be set as for downlink Ethernet flows;
-	the CP function may then provision a PDR for the same PFCP session but the opposite direction, by provisioning the Ethernet Filter ID in the Ethernet filter ID field of the PDI, without provisioning again the Ethernet Filter Properties and Ethernet filter definition.; 
-	when being provisioned with a bidirectional Ethernet Filter in a PDR, the UP function shall apply the Ethernet filter according to the direction of the PDR as specified in clause 5.13.3A, i.e. the UP function shall apply the Ethernet filter parameters provisioned for the Ethernet filter ID, but with swapping the source and destination MAC addresses, and the source and destination IP addresses if any, if the PDR is set for uplink Ethernet flows;
-	the UP function shall apply any modification of a bidirectional Ethernet Filter to all PDRs of the PFCP session making use of this Ethernet Filter; 
-	upon deletion of a PDR making use of a bidirectional Ethernet Filter, the UP function shall still apply the Ethernet Filter for any other PDR making use of the Ethernet Filter.
The requirements specified for provisioning of MAC addresses and SDF Filters in clause 5.13.A shall also apply when provisioning bidirectional Ethernet Filters.  
5.13.5	Reporting of UE MAC addresses to the SMF
In a PFCP Session Establishment Request or a PFCP Session Modification Request, the SMF may request the UPF to start or stop (in a PFCP Sesssion Modification Request only) reporting the UE MAC addresses, i.e. the different MAC (Ethernet) addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by the UE in a PDU Session, by: 
-	creating a URR requesting the UPF to report Ethernet traffic information (i.e. with the Reporting Trigger set to 'MAC Addresses Reporting'); and
-	associating the URR to the PDR provisioned for the UL traffic of the PDU session.
The SMF may additionally request the UPF to detect and report when no user plane packets are received for an UE MAC address, by provisioning the Ethernet Inactivity Timer IE in the URR. 
When being requested to start reporting the UE MAC addresses, the UPF shall: 
-	report immediately any UE MAC addresses known to be associated to the PDU session (e.g. if the request to start monitoring of traffic is received after the PFCP session establishment and if the UPF monitors the UE MAC addresses for the routing of DL traffic); 
-	report new UE MAC addresses that are detected subsequently; 
-	report UE MAC addresses that are removed subsequently from the PDU session, based on the detection of absence of traffic during the Ethernet Inactivity Timer, if this timer is provisioned in the URR. 
NOTE:	Numerous UE MAC addresses can be used by a same PDU session. The UP function can defer a bit the reporting of newly detected or removed UE MAC addresses to allow the reporting of multiple UE MAC addresses in a same usage report. Details are implementation specific.
5.14	Support IPv6 Prefix Delegation
Clause 5.3.1.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] specifies the requirements for IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6, that allow assigning a single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix to a PDN connection. 
When assigning additional IPv6 prefixes (i.e. prefixes in addition to the default prefix) to a UE, the CP function shall provision/update the UE IP Address IE in the UP function with the IPv6D flag set to "1" and IPv6 Prefix Delegation Bits field to indicating the length of IPv6 Prefix for delegation.
5.15	Signalling based Trace (De)Activation
The UP function shall set the TRACE feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports Trace (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [35]). 
If the UP function indicated support of Trace, the CP function may activate a trace session during a PFCP session establishment or a PFCP session modification procedure, by including the Trace Information IE in the PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request. 
The CP function may deactivate an on-going trace session by including the Trace Information IE with a null length in a PFCP Session Modification Request.    
There shall be at most one trace session activated per PFCP session at a time.
5.16	Framed Routing
Framed routing allows to support an IP network behind a UE, such that a range of IP addresses or IPv6 prefixes is reachable over a single PDU session, e.g. for enterprise connectivity. Framed routes are IP routes behind the UE. The UPF advertizes relevant IP routes to receive packets destined to these destination IP addresses or IPv6 prefixes and to forward these packets over the PDU session. See clause 5.6.14 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28], IETF RFC 2865 [37], IETF RFC 3162 [38]) and the Framed-Route, Framed-Routing and Framed-IPv6-Route AVPs specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and 3GPP TS 29.561 [49]. 
Framed routing is defined only for PDN connections and PDU sessions of the IP type (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6).
A UPF may indicate support of framed routing by setting the FRRT flag in the UP Function Features IE. If so, the CP function may include Framed-Route IEs, the Frame-Routing IE and Framed-IPv6-Route IEs in DL PDRs to describe framed routes associated to the PDU session.
5.17	5G UPF (for 5GC)
5.17.1	Introduction
The following clauses describe the 5GS specific functionalites of a UP function.
5.17.2	Uplink Classifier and Branching Point
The Uplink Classifier and Branching Point functionalities refer to the capability of the UPF to route uplink traffic flows of the same PFCP session (PDU session) to two or more PDU Sessions Anchors, and to route the downlink traffic flows from these PDU Session Anchors on the tunnel towards the UE. They are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [28] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [29].
Uplink Classifier is supported for PDU sessions of type IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6 or Ethernet. The routing of the uplink traffic flows to different PDU Session Anchors is based e.g. on the destination IP address/Prefix of the uplink packets for an IP PDU session.
Branching Point is supported for multi-homed PDU sessions of type IPv6, i.e. PDU sessions with multiple IPv6 prefixes. The routing of the uplink traffic flows to different PDU Session Anchors is based on the source IP prefix of the uplink packets.
The SMF may insert an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU session establishment or modification, by provisioning:
-	two or more UL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and with corresponding FARs to route the uplink traffic flows towards the appropriate PDU Session Anchors; 
-	two or more DL PDRs, with the appropriate Packet Detection Information, and with one (or more FARs) to route the downlink traffic flows on the tunnel towards the UE.
NOTE 1:	This uses the generic functionalities of the PFCP protocol described in this specification, with two or more DL PDRs (for the traffic coming from the different PDU session anchors).  
NOTE 2:	A UPF acting as an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point can also behave as a PDU Session Anchor for the PDU session. 
The SMF may remove an Uplink Classifier or Branching Point, during a PDU session modification, by removing the UL (or modifying the FAR associated to the UL PDR) and DL PDRs that were setup for the traffic to/from the PDU Session Anchor(s) to be removed.
5.17.3	Data Forwarding during handovers between 5GS and EPS 
Data forwarding during handovers between 5GS and EPS is supported as follows (see 3GPP TS 38.300 [42]):  
-	For 5G to 4G handover, the source NG-RAN node sends one or several end markers including one QFI of those QoS flows mapped to the same E-RAB and sends the end marker packets to the UPF over the PDU session tunnel. UPF removes the QFI and maps to an appropriate E-RAB tunnel towards SGW.
-	For 4G to 5G handover, the source eNB forwards the received end markers in the EPS bearer tunnel to the SGW which forwards them to the UPF. The UPF adds one QFI among the QoS flows mapped to that E-RAB to the end markers and sends those end markers to the target NG-RAN node in the per PDU session tunnel. 
To forward data (G-PDUs and End Marker packets) during a 5GS to EPS handover, the SMF shall: 
-	provision one PDR per E-RAB (that supports data forwarding for at least one QoS flow), with the list of QFIs that are mapped to the E-RAB; 
-	request the UPF to remove the GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header (including the QFI) from the data by including the GTP-U Extension Header Deletion field set to 'PDU Session Container' in the Outer Header Removal IE of the PDR(s); 
-	associate to each PDR a FAR to forward the data to the GTP-U tunnel of the corresponding E-RAB, i.e. with an Outer Header Creation IE containing the F-TEID of the (forwarding) SGW for the corresponding forwarding GTP-U tunnel; 
To forward data (G-PDUs and End Marker packets) during an EPS to 5GS handover, the SMF shall: 
-	provision one PDR per E-RAB (that supports data forwarding for at least one QoS flow);  
-	create and associate one QER with each PDR, including the QFI IE set to the QFI value of one of the QoS flows mapped to the E-RAB, to request the UPF to insert a GTP-U PDU Session Container extension header including the QFI; 
-	create one FAR for each data forwarding tunnel in 5GS (i.e. per PDU session), with an Outer Header Creation IE containing the F-TEID of the target NG-RAN for the corresponding forwarding GTP-U tunnel; 
-	associate each PDR to the corresponding FAR (i.e. to forward the data of each E-RAB to the data forwarding tunnel of the corresponding PDU session).
5.17.4	Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interfaces
Stage 2 requirements for support of Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 interfaces for high reliability communication are specified in clause 5.33.2.2 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. 
This requires duplicating downlink and uplink packets of QoS flows requiring redundant transmission of a PDU session via two independent N3 or N9 tunnels between the RAN and the UPF (PSA).
If redundant transmission is required for a QoS flow, the SMF shall instruct the PSA UPF to replicate each downlink packet of the QoS Flow and to assign a sequence number to them as follows: 
Editor's note: how to request the UPF to duplicate downlink packets is FFS.
If redundant transmission is required for a QoS flow, the SMF shall instruct the PSA UPF to eliminate the duplicated uplink packets of the QoS Flow, based on their sequence numbers, as follows: 
Editor's note: how to request the UPF eliminate the duplicate uplink packets is FFS.
Editor's note: how to realize the sequence number for support of redundant transmission is FFS.
5.18	Enhanced PFCP Association Release
5.18.1 General
To ensure no loss of usage reports and signalling efficiency, during a PFCP Association Release procedure, which is either initiated by CP function, or upon request from the UP function,  the CP function and UP function may support the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) as described below.
When both the CP function and the UP function support the EPFAR feature, and when the CP (or UP) function determines that the PFCP association is to be released, the CP (or UP) function shall send a PFCP Association Update Request message with a "PFCP Association Release Preparation Start" flag to inform the peer UP (or CP) function that the PFCP Association is going to be released and the final non-zero usage reports are to be collected for these PFCP sessions which will be affected by PFCP association release. 
The CP function should stop establishing new PFCP sessions in the UP function after receiving or sending a PFCP Association Release Preparation Start indication.
Then the UP function shall initiate the PFCP Session Release procedure as specified in clause 5.18.2 by sending one or more PFCP Session Report Request messages for the PFCP sessions affected by the release of the PFCP association and that have non-zero usage reports to be reported. In the PFCP Session Report Request message, the UP function shall: 
-	set the Usage Report Trigger to TEBUR (Termination By UP function Report) for the usage reports being reported; and
-	set the PSDBU (PFCP Session Deleted By the UP function) flag to "1" to indicate to the CP function that the PFCP Session is being deleted in the UP funciton and the usage reports included in the message are the final usage reports for the given PFCP Session, if this is the last PFCP Session Report Request message sent for the PFCP session. 
When the UP function has sent all the non-zero usage reports for the PFCP sessions affected by the release of the PFCP Association, the UP function shall send a PFCP Association Update Request with the flag URSS (non-zero Usage Reports for the affected PFCP Sessions Sent) set to 1 to indicate to the CP function that all non-zero usage reports for the affected PFCP sessions have been sent to the CP function and the corresponding PFCP sessions in the UP function have been locally deleted.
The CP function shall then send a PFCP Association Release Request to release the PFCP Association as specified in clause 6.2.8. 
5.18.2 UP Function Initiated PFCP Session Release
When the UP function needs delete a PFCP sesssion, e.g. during the the Enhanced PFCP Association Release as described in 5.18.1 or when it detects an error, the UP function shall:
-	send one or more PFCP Session Report Request messages for this PFCP session;  
-	set the Usage Report Trigger to "TEBUR" for non-zero usage report(s), if usage reports are included in the PFCP Session Report Request message(s); and 
-	set the PSDBU flag to "1" to indicate to the CP function that the PFCP session is being deleted, in the last PFCP Session Report Request message sent for that PFCP session.
5.19	Activation and Deactivation of Pre-defined PDRs
To reduce the signalling overhead for establishing a PFCP session (for a PDU session or a PDN connection) and improve the signalling efficiency, the CP and UP functions may support the Activation and Deactivation of a Pre-defined PDR (ADPDP) feature as described below. 
When both the CP function and the UP function support the ADPDP feature, the CP function may activate one or more pre-defined PDRs for a PFCP session during a PFCP Session Establishment or a PFCP Session Modification procedure. A pre-defined PDR shall be configured in the UP function before it can be activated in a PFCP session. 
A pre-defined PDR may contain all the necessary packets detection information to identify a service data flow or application traffic which may be common to many PFCP sessions, and it may be configured in the UPF associated with a pre-defined FAR, one or more pre-defined QER(s), and/or one or more pre-defined URR(s). 
Any PFCP session specific information, e.g. traffic endpoint information, may not be part of a pre-defined PDR and is provisioned before or during the activation of the pre-defined PDR. 
To activate one or more pre-defined PDR(s), the CP function shall provide one or more Activate Predefined Rules IE(s) in a Create PDR IE in a PFCP Session Establishment Request, or in a Create PDR IE or an Update PDR IE in a PFCP Session Modification Request message, that references a pre-defined PDR configured in the UP function, with the following information in the Create PDR or Update PDR IE:
-	the traffic endpoint that the traffic shall match (e.g. Local F-TEID, UE IP Address or Traffic Endpoint ID);
-	optionally the QFI that the traffic shall match, e.g. for a UL PDR where UL QoS flow binding verification is required (see clause 5.4.2);
-	the precedence to be applied by the UP function among all PDRs of the PFCP session;
-	optionally, a FAR containing instructions related to the processing of the packets matching the pre-defined PDR(s); when present, the UP function shall enforce it instead of the one defined in the pre-defined PDR(s) if any; 
-	optionally, one or more URRs to be used in addition to any URR(s) specified in the pre-defined PDR(s) (e.g. for session level Usage Monitoring);
-	optionally, one or more QERs to be applied in addition to any QER(s) specified in the pre-defined PDR (e.g. for APN-AMBR enforcement).
When a pre-defined PDR is activated for a given PDR, an incoming packet matches the PDR if it matches the traffic endpoint, and the QFI if provisioned and one of the activated pre-defined PDR(s).
The CP function may update the use of pre-defined PDRs that are already activated in a PFCP session by including one or more Activate Predefined Rules IE(s) or Deactivate Predefined Rules IE(s) in a PFCP Session Modification Request and/or by updating the parameters provisioned in the PDR.
NOTE:	The CP function can not change a pre-defined PDR via PFCP session related procedure.
The CP function may deactivate a pre-defined PDR that is already activated in a PFCP session by including the Deactivate Predefined Rules IE in a PFCP Session Modification Request requesting to deactivate the predefined PDR(s).
In addition, this feature allows to define a group of pre-defined PDRs which can be activated, updated, and deactivated together. This allows the CP function to further optimize the signaling towards the UP function.
To activate, update, or deactivate a group of pre-defined PDRs, the CP shall follow the same procedure as for activating, updating, and deactivating a pre-defined PDR, but it shall use an Activate Predefined Rules IE that refers to a group of pre-defined PDRs.
5.20	Support of Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting for 5GC
5.20.1	General
The Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network. The multi-access PDU Connectivity Service is realized by establishing a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session, i.e. a PDU Session that may have user-plane resources on two access networks.
Support of the ATSSS feature is an optional for the SMF and UPF, for 5GC. See 3GPP TS 23.501 [28]. 
When establishing a N4 session for a MA PDU session, the (h)SMF shall select a (h)UPF supporting the MA PDU Session Capability, i.e. ATSSS-LL capability, MPTCP capability, or both, and the h(SMF) shall provision a Multi-Access Rule for every downlink PDR which is used to match traffic sent towards the UE in the N4 session. (See also clause 5.2.7)
5.20.2 MPTCP functionality
Editor's Note: This clause will document any impact on N4 to support MPTCP functionality in UPF.
5.20.3 ATSSS-LL functionality
Editor's Note: This clause will document any impact on N4 to support ATSSS-LL functionality in UPF, including support of Access Network Performance Measurement function, i.e. PMF.
5.21	UE IP address/prefix Allocation and Release (for 5GC) 
5.21.1	General
A UE IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix may be allocated by the CP function or the UP function. A given IP address pool shall be controlled by a unique entity (either the SMF or the UPF or an external server).
The support of UE IP address/prefix allocation by the CP function is mandatory. The support of UE IP address/prefix allocation by the UP function is optional. See clause 5.8.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [28].
The UP function shall set the UEIP feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function (see clause 8.2.25). If so, the CP function shall determine whether UE IP address or prefix is allocated by the CP function or the UP function based on network configuration. 
5.21.2	UE IP address/prefix allocation in the CP function
When performing UE IP address allocation in the CP function, the CP function shall assign the UE IP address/prefix and provide the assigned address/prefix to the UP function in the UE IP Address IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1) or of the Traffic Endpoint (see Table 7.5.2.7-1).
5.21.3	UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function
When performing UE IP address/prefix allocation in the UP function, the CP function shall request the UP function to allocate the UE IP address/prefix by: 
-	setting the CHOOSE flag in the UE IP Address IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1) or of the Traffic Endpoint (see Table 7.5.2.7-1); and
-	including the Network Instance IE to indicate the IP address pool from which the UE IP address/prefix is to be assigned.
The CP function may request the UP function to allocate the same UE IP address/prefix to several PDRs to be created within one single PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request by: 
-	setting the CHOOSE flag in the UE IP Address IE of each PDR to be created with a new UE IP address/prefix; 
or, if the UP function indicated support of the PDI optimization (see clause 8.2.25), by:
-	including the UE IP Address IE only in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE and by setting the CHOOSE flag in the UE IP Address IE of this IE; and
-	including the Traffic Endpoint ID in all the PDRs to be created with the same UE IP address.
If the PDR(s) is created successfully, the UP function shall return the UE IP address/prefix it has assigned to the PDR(s) or to the Traffic Endpoint(s) in the PFCP Session Establishment Response or PFCP Session Modification Response. 
Upon receiving a request to delete a PFCP session, to remove a Traffic Endpoint, or to remove the last PDR associated with the UE IP address/prefix, the UP function shall release the UE IP address/prefix that was assigned to the PFCP session, to the Traffic Endpoint, or to the PDR.
5.22	PFCP sessions successively controlled by different SMFs of an SMF set (for 5GC)
When a UPF supports that a PFCP session can be successively controlled by different SMF(s) in the same SMF set, the following applies: 
1)	One SMF in the SMF set shall establish one single PFCP Association with the UPF for the SMF set; the Node ID in the PFCP Association Setup Request shall be set to an FQDN representing the SMF set. 

The SMF shall indicate that it supports the SSET feature in the CP Function Features IE (see clause 8.2.58); this indicates to the UPF that the PFCP sessions established with this PFCP association can be successively controlled by different SMFs of an SMF set. 

The SMF may also indicate the IP addresses of alternative SMFs within the SMF Set in the PFCP Association Setup Request. 
2)	When establishing a PFCP session, an SMF shall assign, in the CP F-SEID of the PFCP Session Establishment Request, a unique SEID within the SMF set; 
3)	Any SMF in the SMF set may issue requests to modify or delete the PFCP session, or to update or release the PFCP association. 
4)	The UPF shall initiate PFCP session related requests (e.g. PFCP Session Report Request) towards any SMF of the SMF Set, if the IP address included in the CP F-SEID assigned to the PFCP session is not responsive, or if the UPF receives a GTP-U Error Indication from the SMF over the N4-u tunnel assigned to the N4 session for data forwarding if any. 

The UPF shall use the IP addresses of alternative SMFs received during the PFCP association setup or update procedures, if any. Otherwise the UPF shall use the SMF set FQDN in the CP Node ID to discover alternative SMFs within the SMF Set, e.g. by querying the DNS or by performing a discovery request towards the NRF.
5)	An SMF may redirect a UPF initiated PFCP session related request to a different SMF in the SMF set by rejecting the request with the cause "Redirection Requested" and with the CP F-SEID IE including the IP address of the new SMF to contact. 

Alternatively, an SMF may forward the UPF request to another SMF in the SMF set; the new SMF answers to the UPF, optionally including the CP F-SEID IE with the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the new SMF, and optionally including the N4-u F-TEID that the UPF shall use for sending data towards the new SMF. 
NOTE 2:	This allows to address cases where a different SMF would have been reselected in the 5GC for the PFCP session, e.g. by an AMF.  
6)	An SMF may also update, at any time, a PFCP session by including the CP F-SEID with the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a new SMF in a PFCP Session Modification Request.  
7)	The UPF shall not trigger the restoration procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.527 [40] for a PFCP session that can be controlled by different SMFs of an SMF set when a heartbeat failure is detected for the IP address of the assigned CP F-SEID. Restoration procedures shall be triggered only if heartbeat procedures fail with all the IP addresses of all the SMFs in the SMF set. 
NOTE 3:	The above requirements enable all SMFs of a same SMF set to successively control a given PFCP session without causing extra signalling over the N4 interface.  
6	Procedures
6.1	Introduction
The following clauses specify the procedures supported over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference points.
6.2	PFCP Node Related Procedures
6.2.1	General
The following clauses specify the node related procedures over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points. The behaviour of the CP function und UP function when sending and receiving a node related message is described.
6.2.2	Heartbeat Procedure
6.2.2.1	General 
Two messages are specified for PFCP heartbeat procedure: Heartbeat Request and Heartbeat Response. The use of these messages is further specified in clause 19A of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24] for EPC, and in clause 4 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [40] for 5GC.
6.2.2.2	Heartbeat Request
The CP function or the UP function may send an Heartbeat Request on a path to the peer node to find out if it is alive. Heartbeat Request messages may be sent for each peer with which an PFCP control association is established.
For each peer with which an PFCP control association is established, a CP function or UP function shall be prepared to receive an Heartbeat Request at any time and it shall reply with an Heartbeat Response.
6.2.2.3	Heartbeat Response
The message shall be sent as a response to a received Heartbeat Request.
6.2.3	Load Control Procedure
6.2.3.1	General
Load Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points.
Load control enables the UP function to send its load information to the CP function to adaptively balance the PFCP session load across the UP functions according to their effective load. The load information reflects the operating status of the resources of the UP function.
Load control allows for better balancing of the PFCP session load, so as to attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Load control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the UP function reports a high load.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently in the network, based on operator's policy.
6.2.3.2	Principles
The UP function may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the operating status of its resources, at the node level, allowing the receiving CP function to use this information to augment the UP function selection procedures. 
The Load Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information does not trigger extra signalling.
NOTE:	The inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages means that the frequency of transmission of load control information increases as the session load increases, allowing for faster feedback and thus better regulation of the load.
The calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes.
6.2.3.3	Load Control Information
6.2.3.3.1	General Description 
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Load Control Information (LCI) IE.
When providing load control information in a message for the first time or subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of load control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Load Control Information, even if only a subset of the load control information has changed. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the load control information is changed (see clause 6.2.3.3.2.1).
Load Control Information shall be linked to the Node ID (i.e. FQDN or the IP address used during the UP function selection) of the UP function providing the Information.
The receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer with the newly received load control information from the same peer node if the new load control information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Load Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored an instance of the load control information for a peer node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer node.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for UP function selection.
The parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.3.3.2.
Load control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:
-	Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.
-	Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter in an instance of the LCI IE towards a receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in future).
6.2.3.3.2	Parameters
6.2.3.3.2.1	Load Control Sequence Number
The Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same UP function. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be supported (if load control is supported) and shall always be present in the LCI IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Load Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load Control Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The UP function may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the generation of the Load Control Information to populate the Load Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control Information IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information, e.g. due to PFCP retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the LCI IE to determine whether the newly received load control information has changed compared to load control information previously received from the same node earlier.
NOTE:	The PFCP sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving entity has already received and stored load control information from the peer UP function, the receiving CP function shall update its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received in the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer UP function. However due to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.
6.2.3.3.2.2	Load Metric
The Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as the used capacity of the UP function, the load in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in relationship to the total memory/CPU available, etc.).
The Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100 means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).
The Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2), in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.
NOTE:	The range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is collected.
6.2.3.3.3	Frequency of Inclusion 
How often the sender includes the load control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is propagated to the target CP functions within an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved. The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:
-	the sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;
-	the sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;
-	the sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control Information only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any of the PFCP messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received load control information.
6.2.4	Overload Control Procedure
6.2.4.1	General
Overload Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points.
Overload control enables a UP function becoming or being overloaded to gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its peer CP functions to reduce sending traffic according to its available signalling capacity to successfully process the traffic. A UP function is in overload when it operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished performance (including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).
Overload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic source as possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action), so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using resources of intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently in the network, based on operator's policy.
6.2.4.2	Principles
When a UP function determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic is growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, the UP function may signal its overload, at node level granularity, to its peer CP functions by including Overload Control Information in PFCP signalling which provides guidance to the receiving CP functions to decide actions which lead to signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information. This helps in preventing severe overload and hence potential breakdown of the UP function.
The Overload Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response messages such that the exchange of Overload Control Information does not trigger extra signalling.
NOTE:	The inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing messages means that the frequency of transmission of overload control information increases as the signalling load increases, thus allowing for faster feedback and better regulation.
The calculation of the Overload Control Information is implementation dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes. The calculation of Overload Control Information should not severely impact the resource utilization of the UP function, especially considering the overload situation.
The overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services.
The overload mitigation actions based on the reception of the overload related information received from the UP function will not be standardized.
6.2.4.3	Overload Control Information
6.2.4.3.1	General Description 
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Overload Control Information (OCI) IE. 
When providing overload control information in a message for the first time or subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of overload control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Overload Control Information, even if only a subset of the overload control information has changed. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the Overload control information is changed (see clause 6.2.4.3.2.1).
The receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer with the newly received overload control information from the same peer node if the new overload control information is more recent than the old information as indicated by the Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored an instance of the Overload control information for a peer node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer node. 
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action. 
The parameters are further defined in clause 6.2.4.3.2.
Overload control information may be extended with new parameters in future versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized as:
-	Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is not critical for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly comprehend the Overload control information instance, containing one or more of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical optional parameter.
-	Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is critical for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload control information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any instance of the OCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver's capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or more critical optional parameter in an instance of the OCI IE towards a receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters. The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new parameter in future).
The Overload Control Information shall be associated by default to the PFCP entity corresponding to the peer node's IP address of the PFCP session, over which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the "UP F-SEID" IE.
Alternatively, the UP function may send Overload Control Information which is associated with the Node ID of the UP function (i.e. FQDN or the IP address used during the UP function selection). In that case, the UP function shall provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in the message belongs to the Node ID.
6.2.4.3.2	Parameters
6.2.4.3.2.1	Overload Control Sequence Number
The PFCP protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents as the original message. Due to PFCP retransmissions, the overload control information received by a CP function at a given time may be less recent than the overload control information already received from the same UP function. The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control information received from an overloaded UP function. The Overload Control Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by the same UP function.
The Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the Overload Control Information IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Overload Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The UP function may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to PFCP retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly received overload control information has changed compared to the overload control information previously received from the same UP function. If the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from the same UP function, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement procedures, as per the previous value.
NOTE 1:	The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see clause 6.2.4.3.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information. If the overload condition persists and the overloaded UP function needs to extend the duration during which the overload information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload control information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even if the parameters within the overload control information have not changed).
NOTE 2:	The PFCP Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving CP function already received and stored overload control information, which is still valid, from the overloaded UP function, the receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control Sequence Number or restart of the UP function, the Overload Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the previous value.
6.2.4.3.2.2	Period of Validity
The Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless overridden by subsequent new overload control information).
An overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received from the same UP function (at which point the newly received overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.
The Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload control).
The Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:
-	it avoids the need for the overloaded UP function to include the Overload Control Information IE in every PFCP messages it signals to its peer CP functions when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the processing required at the overloaded UP function and its peer CP functions upon sending/receiving PFCP signalling;
-	it allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the peer CP functions having received an overload indication from the overloaded UP function, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these PFCP entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes the need for the overloaded UP function to remember the list of CP functions to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it would subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the Period of Validity parameter was not defined.
6.2.4.3.2.3	Overload Reduction Metric
The Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload Reduction Metric of "0" always indicates that the UP function is not in overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for the indicated scope.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver.
NOTE:	The range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender to collect its own overload information at every increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is collected.
The computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an implementation choice at the sending UP function.
The Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.
The inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occuring, unless the Overload Reduction Metric is set to 0, which signals that the overload condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does not mean that the overload has abated.
6.2.4.3.3	Frequency of Inclusion 
How often or when the sender includes the overload control information is implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:
-	the sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed value has not already been provided to the given receiver;
-	the sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the receiver;
-	the sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period. 
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information received in any of the PFCP messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such reception, shall be able act upon the received information.
6.2.4.4	Message Throttling
6.2.4.4.1	General
As part of the overload mitigation, a CP function shall reduce the total number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called "message throttling".
Message throttling shall only apply to Request messages. Response messages should not be throttled since that would result in the retransmission of the corresponding request message by the sender.
A CP function supporting PFCP overload control shall support and use the "Loss" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.
6.2.4.4.2	Throttling algorithm  -  "Loss"
6.2.4.4.2.1	Description
An overloaded UP function shall ask its peers to reduce the number of requests they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the "Overload-Reduction-Metric", as specified in clause 6.2.4.3.2.
The recipients of the "Overload-Reduction-Metric" shall reduce the number of requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate destination if possible (e.g. the PFCP Session Establishment Request message may be redirected to an alternate UP function), or by failing the request and treating it as if it was rejected by the destination UP function. 
For example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would have otherwise been sent to this UP function.
The overloaded UP function should periodically adjust the requested traffic reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use, the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the current overall received traffic. 
Annex A.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of the "Loss" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
NOTE 1:	This algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the overloaded UP function will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that the total traffic sent towards the overloaded UP function is less than what would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded UP function receives more traffic than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening rather than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded UP function can request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives, approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.
NOTE 2:	Since the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes (depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from other source nodes.
6.2.4.5	Message Prioritization
6.2.4.5.1	Description
When performing message throttling:
-	PFCP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP TS 22.153 [15]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these PFCP requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction, and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to PFCP overload control up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;
-	for other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of the procedure for which the message is being sent or may be derived from the session parameters such as APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator (LAPI).
NOTE:	A random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation mechanism and bad user experience.
An overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of a self-protection mechanism.
6.2.4.5.2	Based on the Message Priority Signalled in the PFCP Message
Message prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative PFCP message priority signalled in the PFCP header (see clause 7.2.2.3). 
A PFCP entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in PFCP signalling, based on operator policy. The requirements specified in this clause shall apply if message priority in PFCP signalling is used.
A sending PFCP entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal in the message according to the principles specified in clause 6.2.4.5.1. If the message affects multiple bearers, the relative message priority should be determined considering the highest priority ARP among all the bearers. 
A PFCP entity should set the same message priority in a Response message as received in the corresponding Request message.
For incoming PFCP messages that do not have a message priority in the PFCP header, the receiving PFCP entity:
-	shall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is a Request message;
-	should apply the message priority sent in the Request message, if the incoming message is a Response message. 
This feature should be supported homogenously across the CP functions and UP functions in the network, otherwise an overloaded node will process Request messages received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default priority while Request messages received from supporting nodes will be processed according to the message priority signalled in the PFCP message.
6.2.5	PFCP PFD Management Procedure
6.2.5.1	General
The PFCP PFD Management procedure may be used by the CP function and UP function to provision PFDs (e.g. received from the PFDF as specified in clauses 5.11.4 and 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]) to the UP function, for one or more Application Identifiers.
Support of this procedure is optional for the CP function and the UP function. The UP function shall set the PFDM feature flag in the UP Function Features IE if it supports the PFD Management procedure (see clause 8.2.25).
The UP function shall store the PFDs provisioned per Application Identifier. These PFDs shall apply to all the PFCP session established in the UP function, for all the controlling CP functions, i.e. the scope of a PFD is not limited to the PFCP sessions established by the CP function which provisioned the PFD. 
NOTE:	Application identifiers preconfigured in the UP function, if any, need to be distinct from application identifiers provisioned via PFD management procedure.
6.2.5.2	CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP PFD Management procedure to provision PFDs in the UP function, for one or more Application Identifier(s).
The CP function:
-	shall send the PFCP PFD Management Request message, including the full set of PFD IDs and PFD contents to be provisioned in the UP function per Application Identifier.
When the CP function receives an PFCP PFD Management Response with cause success, the CP function shall consider that the PFDs have been provisioned as requested.
6.2.5.3	UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP PFD Management Request message, it shall:
-	if no Application ID's PFDs IE is present in the request (i.e. empty message), 
-	delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for all Application Identifier(s) provisioned via the PFD Management Procedure;
-	if at least one Application ID's PFDs IE is present in the request, 
-	delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for the indicated Application Identifier(s);
-	store all the PFDs received in the request for the indicated Application Identifier(s); 
-	send a PFCP PFD Management Response with the cause "success", if the above operations were performed successfully.
-	if a PFD is removed/modified and this PFD was used to detect application traffic related to an application identifier in a PDR created/activated for a PFCP session and the UP function has reported the application start to the CP function for the application instance corresponding to this PFD as defined in clause 5.4.11 ((Un)solicited Application Reporting), the UP function shall report the application stop to the CP function for the corresponding application instance identifier as defined in clause 5.4.11 if the removed/modified PFD in UP results in the stop of the application instance is not being able to be detected. See clause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
6.2.6	PFCP Association Setup Procedure
6.2.6.1	General 
The PFCP Association Setup procedure shall be used to setup an PFCP association between a CP function and a UP function, to enable the CP function to use the resources of the UP function subsequently, i.e. establish PFCP Sessions.
The setup of an PFCP association may be initiated by the CP function (see clause 6.2.6.2) or the UP function (see clause 6.2.6.3).
The CP function and the UP function shall support the PFCP Association Setup initiated by the CP function. The CP function and the UP function may additionally support the PFCP Association Setup initiated by the UP function.
6.2.6.2	PFCP Association Setup Initiated by the CP Function
6.2.6.2.1	CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Association Setup procedure to request to setup an PFCP association towards a UP function prior to establishing a first PFCP session on this UP function.
The CP function:
-	shall retrieve an IP address of the UP function to send the PFCP Association Setup Request, as specified in clause 5.8.1. 
-	shall send the PFCP Association Setup Request with the Node ID of the CP function;
-	shall include the list of optional features the CP function supports which may affect the UP function behaviour, if any.
The CP function shall only initiate PFCP Session related signalling procedures toward a UP function after it receives the PFCP Association Setup Response with a successful cause from this UP function.
The CP function shall determine whether the UP function supports Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and/or combined Sxa/Sxb by local configuration or optionally via DNS if deployed.
6.2.6.2.2	UP Function behaviour
When receiving an PFCP Association Setup Request, the UP function:
-	if the request is accepted:
-	shall store the Node ID of the CP function as the identifier of the PFCP association;
-	shall send an PFCP Association Setup Response with a successful cause, its Node ID, and information of all supported optional features in the UP function and optionally the available user plane resources, e.g. IP address(es) or F-TEID range;
-	shall send an PFCP Version Not Supported Response if the PFCP header of the request indicates a PFCP protocol version that is not supported by the UP function;
-	otherwise, shall send an PFCP Association Setup Response with an appropriate error cause if the request is rejected.
6.2.6.3	PFCP Association Setup Initiated by the UP Function
6.2.6.3.1	UP Function Behaviour
The UP function initiates the PFCP Association Setup procedure to request to setup an PFCP association towards a CP function. The UP function is configured with a set of CP functions to which it shall establish an PFCP association.
The UP function:
-  shall retrieve an IP address of the CP function, e.g. based on local configuration in the UP function; 
-	shall send the PFCP Association Setup Request including the Node ID of the UP function and information of all supported optional features in the UP function and optionally the available user plane resources, e.g. IP address(es) or F-TEID range.
6.2.6.3.2	CP Function Behaviour
When receiving an PFCP Association Setup Request, the CP function:
-	if the request is accepted:
-	shall store the Node ID of the UP function as the identifier of the PFCP association;
-	shall send an PFCP Association Setup Response with a successful cause, its Node ID, and information of the list of optional features the CP function supports which may affect the UP function behaviour, if any;
-	shall send an PFCP Version Not Supported Response if the PFCP header of the request indicates a PFCP protocol version that is not supported by the CP function;
-	otherwise, shall send an PFCP Association Setup Response with an appropriate error cause if the request is rejected.
The CP function shall only initiate PFCP Session related signalling procedures toward a UP function after it has sent the PFCP Association Setup Response with a successful cause to the UP function. 
The CP function shall determine the UP function supports Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and/or combined Sxa/Sxb by local configuration or optionally via DNS if deployed. 
6.2.7	PFCP Association Update Procedure
6.2.7.1	General
The PFCP Association Update procedure shall be used to modify an existing PFCP association between the CP function and the UP function. It may be initiated by the UP function or by the CP function to update the supported features or available resources of the UP function.
6.2.7.2	PFCP Association Update Procedure Initiated by the CP Function
6.2.7.2.1	CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Association Update procedure to report changes to the PFCP association to the UP function, e.g. to update the supported features. 
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, the CP function may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the "PFCP Association Release Preparation Start" flag set to "1" when the CP function decides to release the PFCP association and request the UP function to report all non-zero usage reports for the PFCP session affected by the release of the PFCP association, as specified in clause 5.18.
6.2.7.2.2	UP Function Behaviour
When receiving an PFCP Association Update Request, the UP function:
-	shall update the list of optional features of the CP function, when received;
-	shall send an PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error cause if the Node ID is not known by the UP Function;
-	shall return an PFCP Association Update Response with a successful cause value, if the PFCP Association Update Request is handled successfully. 
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, and the CP function has set the "PFCP Association Release Preparation" set to "1"  in the PFCP Association Update Request message, the UP function shall send PFCP Session Report Request messages to report non-zero usage reports (at least one message per PFCP Session) for the PFCP Sessions affected by the release of the PFCP association, as specified in clause 5.18.
6.2.7.3	PFCP Association Update Procedure Initiated by UP Function
6.2.7.3.1	UP Function Behaviour
The UP function initiates the PFCP Association Update procedure to report changes to the PFCP association to the CP function, e.g. change of optional features, change of the available user plane resources, an indication to request to release the PFCP association.
The UP function may send an PFCP Association Update Request to request the CP function to perform the release of the PFCP association, optionally providing a Graceful Release Period. 
When the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) (see clause 5.18) is supported by both the CP function and UP function, the UP function:
-	may send a PFCP Association Update Request with the flag "PFCP Association Release Preparation" set to "1" when the UP function decides to release the PFCP association and thus inform the CP function that all non-zero usage reports for those PFCP session affected by the release of the PFCP association will be reported; 
-	shall then send a PFCP Association Update Request, with the URSS flag set to "1" once all non-zero usage reports for all the PFCP Sessions affected by the release of PFCP Association have been sent to the CP function. 
After reception of the PFCP Association Update Response, the UP function shall consider that the PFCP association is still setup until receiving an PFCP Association Release Request.
6.2.7.3.2	CP Function Behaviour
When receiving an PFCP Association Update Request, the CP function:
-	shall update the list of optional features of the UP function, when received;
-	shall send an PFCP Association Update Response with an appropriate error cause if the Node ID is not known by the CP Function;
-	shall return an PFCP Association Update Response with a successful cause value if the PFCP Association Update Request is handled successfully.
If the UP function has requested to release the PFCP association in the PFCP Association Update Request, the CP function should initiate an PFCP Association Release Request to release the PFCP association, as soon as possible if no Graceful Release Period was included in the request or before the expiry of the Graceful Release Period. The CP function should stop creating new PFCP sessions in the UP function during the Graceful Release Period. When the final usage report(s) for a PFCP Session (upon being deleted) is required, e.g. based on operator policies, the CP function should initiate a PFCP Session Deletion Procedure to collect the usage reports per PFCP Session affected by the release of PFCP Association before the Graceful Release Period is expired.
When both the CP function and UP function support the EPFAR feature, and if the UP function has set the URSS flag to "1" in the PFCP Association Update Request message, the CP function shall immediately initiate the PFCP Association Release Procedure, as specified in clause 5.18.
If the UP function has included User Plane IP Resource Information IE in the PFCP Association Update Request message, the CP function shall use it to overwrite the User Plane IP Resource Information previously received from the UP function.
If the UP function has included UE IP address Pool Identity IE in the PFCP Association Update Request message, the CP function shall use it to overwrite the UE IP address Pool Identity previously received from the UP function.
6.2.8	PFCP Association Release Procedure
6.2.8.1	General
The PFCP Association Release procedure shall be used to terminate the PFCP association between the CP Function and the UP Function due to e.g. OAM reasons. The PFCP Association Release Request may be initiated by the CP function.
When the final usage report(s) for a PFCP Session is required, e.g. based on the operator policies, the CP function should retrieve the final usage reports for the PFCP Sessions affected by the release of PFCP Association, i.e. by initiating a PFCP Session Deletion Procedure towards the UP function for every PFCP session, before it initiates PFCP Association Release Request.
6.2.8.2	CP Function Behaviour
If the CP function initiates the PFCP Association Release procedure to release an existing PFCP association, the CP function:
-	shall delete locally all the PFCP sessions related to that PFCP association when receiving the PFCP Association Release Response with the cause value success.
6.2.8.3	UP Function behaviour
When the UP function receives an PFCP Association Release Request, the UP function:
-	shall delete all the PFCP sessions related to that PFCP association locally;
-	shall delete the PFCP association and any related information (e.g. Node ID of the CP function);
-	shall send an PFCP Association Release Response with a successful cause.
NOTE:	The UP function always accepts an PFCP Association Release Request.
6.2.9	PFCP Node Report Procedure
6.2.9.1	General
The PFCP Node Report procedure shall be used by the UP function to report information to the CP function which is not related to a specific PFCP session, e.g. to report a user plane path failure affecting all the PFCP sessions towards a remote GTP-U peer.
6.2.9.2	UP Function Behaviour
The UP function shall initiate the PFCP Node Report procedure to report information to the CP function. The UP function:
-	shall send the PFCP Node Report Request message, including the information to be reported.
When the UP function receives an PFCP Node Report Response with the cause success, the UP function shall consider the information successfully delivered to the CP function.
6.2.9.3	CP Function behaviour
When the CP function receives an PFCP Node Report Request message, it shall:
-	process the information being reported as appropriate and send an PFCP Node Report Response with the cause "success";
-	otherwise return an appropriate error cause value.
6.3	PFCP Session Related Procedures
6.3.1	General
The following clauses describe the session related procedures over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference points. The behaviour of the CP function and UP function when sending and receiving session related messages is described.
6.3.2	PFCP Session Establishment Procedure
6.3.2.1	General
The PFCP Session Establishment procedure shall be used to setup an PFCP session between CP function and UP function and configure Rules in the UP function so that the UP function can handle incoming packets.
6.3.2.2	CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Session Establishment procedure to create a PFCP session for a PDN connection, or IP-CAN session or TDF session or for applying a certain IP packets treatment which is not associated with any PDN connection or TDF session.
The CP function:
-	shall send the PFCP Session Establishment Request message with a new PFCP F-SEID together with Rules to be created;
-	may assign a local F-TEID for the access side and/or core side and provide it in the PDI, if F-TEID allocation is performed in the CP function.
When the CP function receives an PFCP Session Establishment Response with cause success, the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggered the PFCP Session Establishment procedure.
6.3.2.3	UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives an PFCP Session Establishment Request message it shall:
-	store and apply the rules received in the request and send an PFCP Session Establishment Response with cause "success", if all rules in the PFCP Session Establishment Request are stored and applied;
-	Otherwise, if at least one rule failed to be stored or applied, return an appropriate error cause value with the Rule ID of the Rule causing the first error, discard all the received rules and not create any PFCP session context.
6.3.3	PFCP Session Modification Procedure
6.3.3.1	General
The PFCP Session Modification procedure shall be used to modify an existing PFCP session, e.g. to configure a new rule, to modify an existing rule, to delete an existing rule.
6.3.3.2	CP Function behaviour
The CP function initiates the PFCP Session Modification procedure to modify an existing PFCP session, e.g. triggered by an modification of PDN connection, IP CAN session or TDF session.
The CP function shall:
-	include a complete PDI if the PDI in the existing PDR is to be updated;
-	remove locally the reference to a rule in the PDRs when the related Rule is deleted;
-	provide all the new, updated or deleted Rules. The Updated Rules shall contain only the information which are changed, added and/or deleted.
The CP function shall not include multiple updates in a PFCP Modification Request message, e.g. Create PDR, Update PDR and Remove PDR, for the same rule identified by the Rule ID.
When the CP function receives an PFCP Session Modification Response with the cause "success" it shall continue with the procedure which has initiated the PFCP Session Modification procedure.
6.3.3.3	UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Modification Request it shall:
-	send the PFCP Session Modification Response message with a rejection cause value set to "Session context not found" if the F-SEID included in the PFCP Session Modification Request message is unknown;
-	reject a modification request which would relate to a rule not existing in the UP function;
-	discard any updates on the PFCP session context included in the PFCP Session Modification Request message if the request is rejected and send an PFCP Session Modification Response with an appropriate error cause together with additional information e.g. indicating the first Rule ID of the Rule causing the error. In this case, the UP function shall continue with the existing PFCP session context for the PFCP session as if the PFCP Session Modification Request had not been received;
-	remove all rules identified by a Rule ID to be removed and remove the Rule ID from the PDR(s) from where they are referenced;
-	send the PFCP Session Modification Response with an acceptance cause value if all the requested modifications are accepted and performed successfully.
6.3.4	PFCP Session Deletion Procedure
6.3.4.1	General
The PFCP Session Deletion procedure shall be used to delete an existing PFCP session between the CP function and the UP function.
6.3.4.2	CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates an PFCP Session Deletion procedure towards the UP function to delete an existing PFCP session e.g. when the corresponding PDN is deleted.
The CP shall:
-	send an PFCP Session Deletion Request with the F-SEID identifying the PFCP session.
When the CP function receives PFCP Session Deletion Response with cause success, the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggers the PFCP Session Deletion procedure.
6.3.4.3	UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a PFCP Session Deletion Request it shall:
-	send the PFCP Session Deletion Response message with a rejection cause set to "Session context not found" if the F-SEID include in the PFCP Session Deletion Request message is unknown;
-	send the PFCP Session Deletion Response message with an acceptance cause if the PFCP session and associated rules are deleted successfully, and include any pending Usage Report(s) in the message.
6.3.5	PFCP Session Report Procedure
6.3.5.1	General
The PFCP Session Report procedure shall be used by the UP function to report information related to the PFCP session to the CP function.
6.3.5.2	UP Function Behaviour
The UP function shall initiate the PFCP Session Report procedure to report information related to an PFCP session to the CP function. The UP function:
-	shall send the PFCP Session Report Request message, identifying the PFCP session for which the report is sent and including the information to be reported.
If the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) is supported by both the CP function and UP function, the UP function may send a PFCP Session Report Request message with the flag PSDBU being set to "1" to the CP function to report that the PFCP session is being deleted in the UP function, as specified in clause 5.18, e.g. to report remaining non-zero usage reports for all URRs in the PFCP Session before the PFCP Session is locally deleted in the UP function during an Enhanced PFCP Association Release procedure.
When the UP function receives an PFCP Session Report Response with the cause success, the UP function shall consider the information to be successfully delivered to the CP function.
6.3.5.3	CP Function Behaviour
When the CP function receives an PFCP Session Report Request message, it shall:
-	send the PFCP Session Report Response message with a rejection cause set to "Session context not found" if the F-SEID included in the PFCP Session Report Request message is unknown;
-	process the information being reported as appropriate and send an PFCP Session Report Response with the cause "success";
-	otherwise return an appropriate error cause value. 
If the Enhanced PFCP Association Release feature (EPFAR) is supported by both the CP function and UP function, the CP function shall consider that a PFCP Session is locally deleted in the UP function upon receiving a PFCP Session Report Request message from the UP function with the flag PSDBU being set to "1". 
6.4	Reliable Delivery of PFCP Messages
Reliable delivery of PFCP messages is accomplished by retransmission of these messages as specified in this clause.
A PFCP entity shall maintain, for each triplet of local IP address, local UDP port and remote peer's IP address, a sending queue with Request messages to be sent to that peer. Each message shall be sent with a Sequence Number and be held until a corresponding Response is received or until the PFCP entity ceases retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique for each outstanding Request message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A PFCP entity may have several outstanding Requests waiting for replies.
When sending a Request message, the sending PFCP entity shall start a timer T1. The sending entity shall consider that the Request message has been lost if a corresponding Response message has not been received before the T1 timer expires. If so, the sending entity shall retransmit the Request message, if the total number of retry attempts is less than N1 times. The setting of the T1 timer and N1 counter is implementation specific.
A retransmitted PFCP message shall have the same message content, including the same PFCP header, UDP ports, source and destination IP addresses as the originally transmitted message.
A Request and its Response message shall have the same Sequence Number value, i.e. the Sequence Number in the PFCP header of the Response message shall be copied from the respective Request message. A Request and its Response messages are matched based on the Sequence Number and the IP address and UDP port.
Not counting retransmissions, a Request message shall be answered with a single Response message. Duplicated Response messages shall be discarded by the receiver. A received Response message not matching an outstanding Request message waiting for a reply should be discarded. 
The PFCP entity should inform the upper layer when detecting an unsuccessful transfer of a Request message to enable the controlling upper entity to take any appropriate measure.
7	Messages and Message Formats
7.1	Transmission Order and Bit Definitions
PFCP messages shall be transmitted in network octet order starting with octet 1 with the most significant bit sent first.
The most significant bit of an octet in a PFCP message is bit 8. If a field in a PFCP message spans over several octets, the most significant bit is bit 8 of the octet with the lowest number, unless specified otherwise.

Figure 7.2.2.3-1: PFCP message Header for session related messages
7.2.2.4	Usage of the PFCP Header
7.2.2.4.1	General
The format of the PFCP header is specified in clause 7.2.2.
The usage of the PFCP header shall be as defined below.
The first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:
-	Bit 1 represents the "S" flag, which indicates if SEID field is present in the PFCP header or not. If the "S" flag is set to 0, then the SEID field shall not be present in the PFCP header. If the "S" flag is set to 1, then the SEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in octets 5 to 12. Apart from the node related messages , in all PFCP messages the value of the "S" flag shall be set to "1".
-	Bit 2 represents the "MP" flag. If the "MP" flag is set to "1", then bits 8 to 5 of octet 16 shall indicate the message priority.
-	Bit 3 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to "0" and the receiving entity shall ignore it. 
-	Bit 4 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to "0" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.
-	Bit 5 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to "0" and the receiving entity shall ignore it.
-	Bits 6 to 8, which represent the PFCP version, shall be set to decimal 1 ("001").
The usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified below.
-	Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are specified in Table 7.3-1 "Message types".
-	Octets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the PFCP header (the first 4 octets). The SEID (if present) and the Sequence Number shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of information elements is specified in clause 8.2 "Information Element Format".
-	When S=1, Octets 5 to 12 represent the Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID) field. This field shall unambiguously identify a session endpoint in the receiving Packet Forward Control entity. The Session Endpoint Identifier is set by the sending entity in the PFCP header of all control plane messages to the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (CP or UP function). If a peer's SEID is not available the SEID field shall be present in a PFCP header, but its value shall be set to "0", "Conditions for sending SEID=0 in PFCP header". 
NOTE:	The SEID in the PFCP header of a message is set to the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity regardless of whether the source IP address of the request message and the IP Destination Address provided by the receiving entity for subsequent request messages are the same or not.
-	Octets 13 to 15 represent PFCP Sequence Number field.
7.2.2.4.2	Conditions for Sending SEID=0 in PFCP Header
If a peer's SEID is not available, the SEID field shall still be present in the header and its value shall be set to "0" in the following messages:
-	PFCP Session Establishment Request message on Sxa/Sxb/Sxc;
-	If a node receives a message for which it has no session, i.e. if SEID in the PFCP header is not known, it shall respond with "Session context not found" cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the SEID used in the PFCP header in the response message shall be then set to "0";
-	If a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g. Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message as specified in clause 7.6, it shall reject the request message. For the response message, the node should look up the remote peer's SEID and accordingly set SEID in the PFCP header and the message cause code. As an implementation option, the node may not look up the remote peer's SEID and set the PFCP header SEID to "0" in the response message. However in this case, the cause value shall not be set to "Session not found".
7.2.3	Information Elements
7.2.3.1	General
The format of PFCP Information Elements are defined in clause 8.2. 
7.2.3.2	Presence Requirements of Information Elements
IEs within PFCP messages shall be specified with one of the following presence requirement:
-	Mandatory: this means that the IE shall be included by the sending entity, and that the receiver diagnoses a "Mandatory IE missing" error when detecting that the IE is not present. A response including a "Mandatory IE missing" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.
-	Conditional: this means that:
-	the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions specified are met;
-	the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the corresponding message type description, based on the parameter combination in the message and/or on the state of the receiving node, to infer if a conditional IE shall be expected. Only if a receiver has sufficient information, if a conditional IE, which is necessary for the receiving entity to complete the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort the procedure.
-	Conditional-Optional: this means that:
-	the IE shall be included by a sending entity complying with the version of the specification, if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and therefore is not up-to-date, cannot send this IE;
-	the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message. If the receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE, then the IE's absence shall not trigger any of the error handling procedures. The handling of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as specified in clause 7.6.
-	Optional: this means that:
-	the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.6.
For conditional IEs, the clause describing the PFCP message explicitly defines the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or optional for that particular message. These conditions shall be defined so that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.
For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the rules:
-	If the grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory grouped IE for the given message;
-	if the grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
-	if the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
-	if the grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.
In all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause 7.6 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.
Only the Cause IE at message level shall be included in the response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted, regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional IEs defined for a given response message. The following are exceptions:
-	the Node ID and Offending IE shall be included as per the requirements specified for the corresponding response message; 
-	the Load Control Information, Overload Control Information and the Failed Rule ID IEs may be included in an PFCP session related message.  
If the Cause IE at Grouped IE level contains a value that indicates that the Grouped IE is not handled correctly, the other IEs in this Grouped IE, other than the Cause IE, may not be included.
7.2.3.3	Grouped Information Elements
A Grouped IE is an IE which may contain other IEs.
Grouped IEs have a length value in the TLV encoding, which includes the added length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped IE with 4 octets long IE header is defined in clause 8.2. Each IE within a grouped IE also shall also contain 4 octets long IE header.
Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall explicitly state if it is a Grouped IE.
NOTE:	Each entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit from the grouped IE closes the scope level. The PFCP message level is the top most scope.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type, but for a different purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have different IE types.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type and for the same purpose are sent with a message, these IEs shall have exactly the same IE type to represent a list.
7.2.3.4	Information Element Type
An IE in a PFCP message or Grouped IE is identified by its IE Type and described by a specific row in the corresponding tables in clause 7.
If several IEs with the same Type are included in a PFCP message or Grouped IE, they represent a list for the corresponding IE name.
An IE Type value uniquely identifies a specific IE.
One IE type value is specified for Vendor Specific IEs.
7.3	Message Types
The PFCP message types to be used over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and N4 reference points are defined in Table 7.3-1.

7.6	Error Handling
7.6.1	Protocol Errors
A protocol error is defined as a message or an Information Element received from a peer entity with an unknown type, or if it is unexpected, or if it has an erroneous content.
The term silently discarded is used in the following clauses to mean that the receiving PFCP entity's implementation shall discard such a message without further processing or that the receiving PFCP entity discards such an IE and continues processing the message. The conditions for the receiving PFCP entity to silently discard an IE are specified in the subsequent clauses.
The handling of unknown, unexpected or erroneous PFCP messages and IEs shall provide for the forward compatibility of PFCP. Therefore, the sending PFCP entity shall be able to safely include in a message a new conditional-optional or an optional IE. Such an IE may also have a new type value. Any legacy receiving PFCP entity shall, however, silently discard such an IE and continue processing the message.
If a protocol error is detected by the receiving PFCP entity, it should log the event including the erroneous message and may include the error in a statistical counter.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 7.2.3.2.
The receiving PFCP entity shall apply the error handling specified in the subsequent clauses.
If the received erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding PFCP message, the PFCP transaction layer shall stop retransmissions and notify the PFCP application layer of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.
7.6.2	Different PFCP Versions
If a PFCP entity receives a message of an unsupported PFCP version, it shall return an PFCP Version Not Supported Response message and silently discard the received message.
7.6.3	PFCP Message of Invalid Length
If a PFCP entity receives a message, which is too short to contain the respective PFCP header, the PFCP-PDU shall be silently discarded.
If a PFCP entity receives a Request message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall send the Response message with Cause IE value set to "Invalid Length".
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message within an IP/UDP packet of a length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall silently discard the message.
7.6.4	Unknown PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives a message with an unknown Message Type value, it shall silently discard the message.
7.6.5	Unexpected PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected request message, for example a known message that is sent over an interface for which the message is not defined, or a message that is sent over an interface for which the message is defined, but the direction is incorrect, then the PFCP entity shall silently discard the message and shall log an error.
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected response message which is not a request message, for example a message for which there is no corresponding outstanding request, it shall discard the message and may log an error. 
7.6.6	Missing Information Elements
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received Request message. Apart from Echo Request message, if one or more mandatory information elements are missing in the received Request message, the PFCP entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE value set to "Mandatory IE missing" with the type of the missing mandatory IE.
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message with Cause IE value set to "Mandatory IE missing", it shall notify its upper layer.
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received Response message without a rejection Cause value. If one or more mandatory information elements are missing, the PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer and should log the error.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in the received Request message, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a PFCP entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE value set to "Conditional IE missing" together with the type of the missing conditional IE.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in the received Response message without a rejection Cause value, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer and should log the error.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see clause 7.2.3.2.
Absence of an optional information element shall not trigger any error handling.
7.6.7	Invalid Length Information Element
An information element has an invalid length when the actual length of the IE is different from the value of the Length field in the IE header. Here, the actual length of the IE means the length of the content field of the received IE.
If a PFCP message contains more than one information elements and one or more of them have invalid length, the receiving PFCP entity can detect which of the IEs have invalid length only in the following cases:
-	If the Length value in the IE header is greater than the overall length of the message;
-	If the invalid length IE is the last one in the message.
Apart from Echo Request message, if a receiving PFCP entity detects information element with invalid length in a Request message, it shall send an appropriate error response with Cause IE value set to "Invalid length" together with the type of the offending IE.
7.6.8	Semantically incorrect Information Element
Apart from Echo Request message, the receiver of a PFCP signalling message Request including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid Value shall discard the request, should log the error, and shall send a response with Cause IE value set to "Mandatory IE incorrect" together with a type and instance of the offending IE.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message Response including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid Value shall notify the upper layer that a message with this sequence number has been received and should log the error. 
If a PFCP entity receives an information element with a value which is shown as reserved, it shall treat that information element as invalid and should log the error. If the invalid IE is received in a Request, and it is a mandatory IE or a verifiable conditional IE, the PFCP entity shall send a response with Cause set to "Mandatory IE incorrect" together with a type and instance of the offending IE.
The principle is: the use of reserved values invokes error handling; the use of spare values can be silently discarded and for IEs with spare values used, processing shall be continued ignoring the spare values.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message including an optional information element with a Value that is not in the range defined for this information element value shall discard this IE, but shall treat the rest of the message as if this IE was absent and continue processing. The receiver shall not check the content of an information element field that is defined as "spare".
All semantically incorrect optional information elements in a PFCP signalling message shall be treated as not present in the message.
7.6.9	Unknown or unexpected Information Element
The receiver of a PFCP message including an unexpected information element with a known Type value that is not defined for this message shall discard the IE and log an error. The receiver shall process the message.
NOTE:	An Information Element in an encoded PFCP message or grouped IE is identified by the IE Type.
7.6.10	Repeated Information Elements
An Information Element is repeated if there is more than one IE with the same IE Type in the scope of the PFCP message (or in the scope of the grouped IE). Such an IE is a member in a list.
If an information element is repeated in a PFCP signalling message in which repetition of the information element is not specified, only the contents of the information element appearing first shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When the number of repetitions of information elements is specified, only the contents of specified repeated information elements shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.

Figure 8.1.1-1: Information Element Format
NOTE 1:	If the Bit 8 of Octet 1 is not set, this indicates that the IE is defined by 3GPP and the Enterprise ID is absent. If Bit 8 of Octet 1 is set, this indicates that the IE is defined by a vendor and the Enterprise ID is present identified by the Enterprise ID.
An IE has the following mandatory fields:
-	Type: this field indicates the type of the Information Element. IE type values within the range of 0 to 32767 are reserved for IE defined by 3GPP and are listed in clause 8.1.2 IE type values within the range of 32768 to 65535 are used for vendor-specific IE and the value allocation is controlled by the vendor.
-	Length: this field contains the length of the IE excluding the first four octets, which are common for all IEs (Type and Length) and is denoted "n" in Figure 8.1.1-1 and in Figure 8.1.1-2. Bit 8 of the lowest numbered octet is the most significant bit and bit 1 of the highest numbered octet is the least significant bit.
An IE has the following optional fields:
-	Enterprise ID: if the IE type value is within the range of 32768 to 65535, this field shall contain the IANA-assigned "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes" value of the vendor defining the IE. The Enterprise ID set to "10415" (IANA-assigned "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes") shall not be used for the vendor specific IEs.
For illustration, Figure 8.1.1-2 depicts the format of a Information Element (IE) defined by 3GPP and is specified in this specification. For IE's defined by 3GPP, the IE type shall be within the range of 0 to 32767.

8.1.2	Information Element Types
A PFCP message may contain several IEs. In order to have forward compatible type definitions for the PFCP IEs, all of them shall be TLV (Type, Length, Value) coded. PFCP IE type values are specified in the Table 8.1.2-1. The last column of this table indicates whether the IE is:
-	Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of octets;
-	Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable number of octets.
For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to "5 to (n+4)". In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then the last field is not present;
-	Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable number of octets.
The last fields are typically specified with the statement: "These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified". The legacy receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.
An IE of any of the above types may have a null length as specified in clause 5.6.3. This shall not be considered as an error by the receiving PFCP entity.
In order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended that the IEs should be arranged in the signalling messages as well as in the grouped IEs, according to the order the IEs are listed in the message definition table or grouped IE definition table in section 7. However the receiving entity shall be prepared to handle the messages with IEs in any order.
Within IEs, certain fields may be described as spare. These bits shall be transmitted with the value set to 0. To allow for future features, the receiver shall not evaluate these bits.

65
Session context not found
This cause shall be returned, if the F-SEID included in a PFCP Session Modification/Deletion Request message is unknown.

66
Mandatory IE missing
This cause shall be returned when the PFCP entity detects that a mandatory IE is missing in a request message

67
Conditional IE missing
This cause shall be returned when the PFCP entity detects that a Conditional IE is missing in a request message.

68
Invalid length
This cause shall be returned when the PFCP entity detects that an IE with an invalid length in a request message

69
Mandatory IE incorrect
This cause shall be returned when the PFCP entity detects that a Mandatory IE is incorrect in a request message, e.g. the Mandatory IE is malformated or it carries an invalid or unexpected value.

70
Invalid Forwarding Policy
This cause shall be used by the UP function in the PFCP Session Establishment Response or PFCP Session Modification Response message if the CP function attempted to provision a FAR with a Forwarding Policy Identifier for which no Forwarding Policy is locally configured in the UP function.

71
Invalid F-TEID allocation option
This cause shall be used by the UP function in the PFCP Session Establishment Response or PFCP Session Modification Response message if the CP function attempted to provision a PDR with a F-TEID allocation option which is incompatible with the F-TEID allocation option used for already created PDRs (by the same or a different CP function).

72
No established PFCP Association 
This cause shall be used by the CP function or the UP function if they receive a PFCP Session related message from a peer with which there is no established PFCP Association.

73
Rule creation/modification Failure 
This cause shall be used by the UP function if a received Rule failed to be stored and  be applied in the UP function.

74
PFCP entity in congestion
This cause shall be returned when a PFCP entity has detected node level congestion and performs overload control, which does not allow the request to be processed.

75
No resources available
This cause shall be returned to indicate a temporary unavailability of resources to process the received request.

76
Service not supported
This cause shall be returned when a PFCP entity receives a message requesting a feature or service that is not supported. 

77
System failure
This cause shall be returned to indicate a system error condition. 

78
Redirection Requested
This cause may be returned to indicate a request to the UPF to redirect its PFCP request to a different SMF. 

79 to 255
Spare for future use in a response message. See NOTE 2.
This value range shall be used by Cause values in a rejection response message. See NOTE 2.
NOTE 1:	This value is or may be used in future version of the specification. If the receiver cannot comprehend the value, it shall be interpreted as an unspecified acceptance cause. Unspecified/unrecognized acceptance cause shall be treated in the same ways as the cause value 1 " Request accepted (success)".
NOTE 2:	This value is or may be used in a future version of the specification. If the receiver cannot comprehend the value, it shall be interpreted as an unspecified rejection cause. Unspecified/unrecognized rejection cause shall be treated in the same ways as the cause value 32 "Request rejected (reason not specified)".

-	Bit 2  -  V6: If this bit is set to "1" and the CH bit is not set, then the IPv6 address field shall be present, otherwise the IPv6 address field shall not be present.
-	Bit 3  -  CH (CHOOSE): If this bit is set to "1", then the TEID, IPv4 address and IPv6 address fields shall not be present and the UP function shall assign an F-TEID with an IP4 or an IPv6 address if the V4 or V6 bit is set respectively. This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
-	Bit 4  -  CHID (CHOOSE ID): If this bit is set to "1", then the UP function shall assign the same F-TEID to the PDRs requested to be created in a PFCP Session Establishment Request or PFCP Session Modification Request with the same CHOOSE ID value. This bit may only be set to "1" if the CH bit it set to "1". This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
-	Bit 5 to 8: Spare, for future use and set to 0.
At least one of the V4 and V6 flags shall be set to "1", and both may be set to "1" for both scenarios:
-	when the CP function is allocating F-TEID, i.e. both IPv4 address field and IPv6 address field may be present;
-	or when the UP function is requested to allocate the F-TEID, i.e. when CHOOSE bit is set to "1", and the IPv4 address and IPv6 address fields are not present.
Octet 6 to 9 (TEID) shall be present and shall contain a GTP-U TEID, if the CH bit in octet 5 is not set. When the TEID is present, if both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are present in the F-TEID IE, then the TEID value shall be shared by both addresses.

-	Bit 1  -  FD (Flow Description): If this bit is set to "1", then the Length of Flow Description and the Flow Description fields shall be present, otherwise they shall not be present.
-	Bit 2  -  TTC (ToS Traffic Class): If this bit is set to "1", then the ToS Traffic Class field shall be present, otherwise the ToS Traffic Class field shall not be present.
-	Bit 3  -  SPI (Security Parameter Index): If this bit is set to "1", then the Security Parameter Index field shall be present, otherwise the Security Parameter Index field shall not be present.
-	Bit 4  -  FL (Flow Label): If this bit is set to "1", then the Flow Label field shall be present, otherwise the Flow Label field shall not be present.
-	Bit 5  -  BID (Bidirectional SDF Filter): If this bit is set to "1", then the SDF Filter ID shall be present, otherwise the SDF Filter ID shall not be present. 
-	Bit 6 to 8: Spare, for future use and set to 0.
The Flow Description field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString as specified in clause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. 
The ToS Traffic Class field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString on two octets as specified in clause 5.3.15 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The Security Parameter Index field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString on four octets and shall contain the IPsec security parameter index (which is a 32-bit field), as specified in clause 5.3.51 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. 
The Flow Label field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString on 3 octets as specified in clause 5.3.52 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and shall contain an IPv6 flow label (which is a 20-bit field). The bits 8 to 5 of the octet "v" shall be spare and set to zero, and the remaining 20 bits shall contain the IPv6 flow label.
An SDF Filter may:
-	be a pattern for matching the IP 5 tuple (source IP address or IPv6 network prefix, destination IP address or IPv6 network prefix, source port number, destination port number, protocol ID of the protocol above IP). In the pattern:
-	a value left unspecified in a filter matches any value of the corresponding information in a packet;
-	an IP address may be combined with a prefix mask;
-	port numbers may be specified as port ranges;
-	the pattern can be extended by the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask;
-	consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, protocol ID of the protocol above IP, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI);
-	consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label (IPv6).
NOTE 1:	The details about the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI), the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label (IPv6) are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [19] clause 15.3.
-	extend the packet inspection beyond the possibilities described above and look further into the packet. Such service data flow filters need to be predefined in the PGW-U, as specified in clause 5.11 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
NOTE 2:	Such filters may be used to support filtering with respect to a service data flow based on the transport and application protocols used above IP, e.g. for HTTP and WAP. Filtering for further application protocols and services can also be supported.
The SDF Filter ID, when present, shall be encoded as an Unsigned32 binary integer value. It shall uniquely identify an SDF Filter among all the SDF Filters provisioned for a given PFCP Session. The source/destination IP address and port information, in a bidirectional SDF Filter, shall be set as for downlink IP flows. The SDF filter for the opposite direction has the same parameters, but having the source and destination address/port parameters swapped. When being provisioned with a bidirectional SDF filter in a PDR, the UP function shall apply the SDF filter as specified in clause 5.2.1A.2A.
8.2.6	Application ID
The Application ID IE type shall be encoded as shown in Figure 8.2.6-1. It contains an Application Identifier referencing an application detection filter in the UP function (e.g. its value may represent an application such as a list of URLs).

Annex A (Informative):
PFCP Load and Overload Control Mechanism
A.1	Throttling Aalgorithms
A.1.1	"Loss" Throttling Algorithm
A.1.1.1	Example of Possible Implementation
This clause provides an example of a possible implementation of the "Loss" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
It is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to decide if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For example, the source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an insignificant amount. 
The algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the 50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards the overloaded node.
Annex B (Normative):
CP and UP Selection Functions with Control and User Plane Separation
B.1	CP Selection Function
B.1.1	General
The SGW-C and PGW-C selection function shall follow the principles specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25] for the SGW and PGW selection functions without Control and User Plane Separation. 
The following additional considerations apply with Control and User Plane Separation:
1.	At most one SGW-C shall be selected per user at any time.
2.	The service area of an SGW-C function shall be aligned with the service area of the corresponding SGW-U functions (see clause 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. All the SGW-U functions in the service area shall have a full meshed connectivity with all the eNBs of TAs and/or all RNCs/BSCs of RAs served by that service area.
3.	The SGW dynamic load reported to the MME/SGSN and the PGW dynamic load reported to the MME/SGSN or TWAN/ePDG should take into account the operating status of the CP and UP functions' resources that the SGW-C/PGW-C is controlling. See clause 6.2.3 for how the CP function obtains load control information from the UP function.
4.	For Dedicated Core Networks (see clause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]), an SGW-C or PGW-C function shall be declared in DNS as dedicated to certain mapped UE usage types if the CP function or if all the UP functions it controls are dedicated to certain mapped UE usage types. In this case, the CP function shall be provisioned in DNS with all the mapped UE usage types that both the CP function and its UP functions support. 
5.	The MME/SGSN shall be able to select an SGW-C and a PGW-C optimized for NR, e.g. for UEs indicating support of dual connectivity with NR in NAS signalling to the MME or SGSN and without subscription restriction to use NR as secondary RAT, according to the requirements specified in clause 5.12.2 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]. The SGW-C and the PGW-C optimized for NR may be a combined SGW-C/PGW-C function optimized for the NR.
B.2	UP Selection Function
B.2.1	General
The following requirements apply for the selection of the UP function:
-	the SGW-C, PGW-C and TDF-C shall be responsible for the selection of the SGW-U, PGW-U and TDF-U respectively;
-	an SGW-C may select different SGW-U functions for different PDN connections of a same user. 
It is implementation specific how to support the UP selection function requirements specified in this clause. Clause B.2.6 specifies one possible implementation.
B.2.2	SGW-U Selection Function
The SGW-C shall be able to select the SGW-U considering the following parameters: 
-	the SGW-U location and the user 's location (i.e. ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN);
-	the SGW-U's capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular UE session to establish;
-	the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating SGW-U to specific Dedicated Core Networks);
-	the SGW-U's dynamic load;
-	the SGW-U's relative static capacity (versus other SGW-Us);
-	the UP Function Selection Information Flags, indicating whether it is desired to select an SGW-U optimized for NR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274 [9].
Based on local policy, if the user's location information is required to be used for selecting the UP function, the SGW-C shall determine the list of candidate SGW-Us taking into account the user 's location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN). 
The SGW-C shall select, among the candidate SGW-U functions, an SGW-U function which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session, considering the information received during the PFCP Association Setup.
B.2.3	PGW-U Selection Function
The PGW-C shall be able to select the PGW-U considering the following parameters:
-	the requested APN for the PDN connection;
-	the PGW-U location and the user 's location;
-	the PGW-U's capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular UE session to establish;
-	the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating PGW-U to specific Dedicated Core Networks); 
-	the PGW-U's dynamic load;
-	the PGW-U's relative static capacity (versus other PGW-Us);
-	whether a PDN connection already exists for the same UE and APN, in which case the same PGW-U shall be selected (to enable APN-AMBR enforcement); 
-	the UP Function Selection Information Flags, indicating whether it is desired to select a PGW-U optimized for NR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.274 [9].
NOTE:	The SGW-U and PGW-U location can be configured in the SGW-C and PGW-C or derived from DNS procedures as specified in clause B.2.2. 
If the PGW-C already assigned a PGW-U to the UE for the requested APN (e.g. UE with multiple PDN connections to the same APN), the PGW-C shall select the same PGW-U for the new PDN connection.
If a non-null IPv4 address and/or a IPv6 prefix is received in the PDN Address Allocation (PAA) IE in the Create Session Request, e.g. static address assignment in the user subscription, the PGW-C shall select a PGW-U which can support the requested UE's IP address and/or IPv6 prefix.
Otherwise, the PGW-C shall determine the list of candidate PGW-Us taking into account the requested APN. 
The PGW-C shall select, among the candidate PGW-U functions, a PGW-U function which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session, considering the information received during the PFCP Association Setup.
B.2.4	Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function
A Combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall be able to select a combined SGW-U/PGW-U function. This shall be possible for all the UE's PDN connections, as shown in Figure B.2.1-1.

Figure B.2.4 -1: SGW-U/PGW-U colocation with Control and User Plane Separation
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined respectively in B.2.2 and B.2.3, with the following additions: 
-	the combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the best couple of SGW-U and PGW-U (e.g. the combined SGW-U/PGW-U function), for the requested APN, among all candidate couples of (SGW-U, PGW-U), instead of selecting independently the SGW-U and the PGW-U.
B.2.5	TDF-U selection function
The TDF-C shall be able to select the TDF-U as specified in clause 5.12.5 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. 
B.2.6	UP Selection Function Based on DNS
B.2.6.1	General
This clause specifies optional DNS procedures to select the SGW-U and PGW-U functions and the requirements which apply when these procedures are supported.
The relative static capacity of an SGW-U and PGW-U may be configured in the DNS.
The Node ID of an SGW-U and PGW-U may take the form of a canonical node name to allow the selection of a SGW-U and PGW-U with the best topological match.
B.2.6.2	SGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The SGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate SGW-Us using DNS procedures taking into account the user 's location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios where the PGW-U is already selected (e.g. TAU with SGW change) and when it is preferred to select a collocated node or a topologically closer node, the SGW-C shall try to select an SGW-U collocated with the PGW-U.
B.2.6.3	PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The PGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate PGW-Us using DNS procedures taking into account the requested APN, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios, when it is preferred to select a collocated node or a topologically closer node, i.e. when such preference is indicated in the canonical node names of the PGW-U functions in the DNS (using "topon" as the first label of canonical node name), the PGW-C shall give precedence to collocation of SGW-U and PGW-U, then to topological closeness (i.e. pairs of SGW-U and PGW-U with canonical node names with the highest number of matching labels). This requires the SGW-C to provide the SGW-U Node ID to the PGW-C.
B.2.6.4	Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined respectively in B.2.4, B.2.6.2 and B.2.6.3.
Annex C (Informative):
Examples scenarios
C.1	General
This clause provides example call flows illustrating how the CP function can provision the UP function to support certain functionalities.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification and in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] prevail over the descriptions in this Annex if there is any difference.
C.2	Charging Support
C.2.1	Online Charging
C.2.1.1	Online Charging Call Flow  -  Normal Scenario
Figure C.2.1.1-1 illustrates the exchanges taking place over the Sxb or Sxc reference points when applying online charging. In this example, the OCS grants quotas by chunks of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request new credits when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.

Figure C.2.1.1-1: Online charging with intermediate and final quotas
1.	Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants an intermediate quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes. 
2.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90 Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes.
3.	Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including the Usage Report Trigger set to "Volume Threshold" and the Volume Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be passed on).
4.	Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new intermediate quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes. 
5.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90 Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes. If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon passing on an extra 85 Mbytes of traffic. 
6.	Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including the Usage Report Trigger set to "Volume Threshold" and the Volume Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be passed on).
7.	Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new final quota of 50 Mbytes and requests the CP function to terminate the service or to redirect the traffic towards a redirect destination when the quota is consumed.
8.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes. If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon passing on an extra 45 Mbytes of traffic.
9.	Upon reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. 50 Mbytes), the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including the Usage Report Trigger set to "Volume Quota" and the Volume Measurement set to 50 Mbytes. The UP function stops passing on traffic.
10.	Upon being notified that the final quota has been reached, the CP function terminates the service (e.g. by preventing the traffic of the corresponding SDF to further pass on in the UP function) or redirects the traffic towards a redirect destination by provisioning a Redirect Information IE within the FAR associated to the traffic.
Figure C.2.1.1-2 illustrates the exchanges taking place over the Sxb or Sxc reference points when applying online charging and the UP function supports being provisioned with the Quota Action to apply when reaching quotas. This example is similar to the previous one, but the CP function provisions the UP function with the action to apply when reaching the final quota.

Figure C.2.1.1-2: Online charging with Quota Action provisioned in the UP function
1 to 7'.	Same as for figure C.2.1.1-1.
8.	The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP function with a Create FAR IE provisioning the action the UP function shall apply when reaching the quota, and with an Update URR IE including the Volume Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes and the FAR ID for Quota Action IE set to the new FAR ID). If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon passing on an extra 45 Mbytes of traffic.
9.	Upon reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. 50 Mbytes), the UP function sends an Sx Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including the Usage Report Trigger set to "Volume Quota" and the Volume Measurement set to 50 Mbytes. 
10.	The UP function applies the quota action provisioned at step 8, i.e. it stops forwarding packets or it redirects the traffic towards a redirect destination, according to the FAR identified in the FAR ID for Quota Action.
C.2.1.2	Online Charging Call Flow with Credit Pooling
C.2.1.2.1	General
Figure C.2.1.2-1 illustrates a signalling flow over the Sxb and Gy reference points when applying online charging, and when the CP function (i.e. PGW-C) is instructed by the OCS to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session. 
C.2.1.2.2	Example Call Flow 1
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C provisions the URR1 and URR2 with the quota received from the OCS respectively for RG1 and RG2 (like if there was no credit pooling).
This reflects one possible implementation option, whereby each quota remains managed independently from the others. This approach can result in extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is exhausted. 

Figure C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)
  1.	Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants: 
	RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP  included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
	RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP  included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.5); 
2.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function, to create:
	A new URR1 for RG1, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3; 
A new URR2 for RG2, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;
A new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with Multiplier 0.5.
	The UP function accepts the request.
3.	The RG1 has consumed 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed 10 counted by URR2; the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = 100 x 0.1 + 10 x 0.5 = 15 < S.  The URR1 triggers sending a usage report towards the the CP function due to reaching the Quota 100. So the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for the URR1. The CP function sends the response message.
4.	Based on operator's policies, the CP function reports used quota for the RG1 to the OCS. The OCS does not grant any quota since the quota for the Credit Pool has not been consumed yet. 
NOTE: This step is skipped in the rest flow.  
5.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URR1, with new quota 100. 
Step 6, 7, 8 and 9 repeats step 3 and 5.
10. The RG1 has consumed another 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed another 10 counted by URR2; the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = (100 + 100 + 100 + 100) x 0.1 + (10 +10 + 10 + 10) x 0.5 = 60 >= S = 60. So the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for:
- the URR3, generated due to reaching quota (60), 
- for the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3 and it has reached the quota 100, and 
- for the URR2 generated due to that it is linked to the URR3. 
The CP function sends the response message.
11.	The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.  
12.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
C.2.1.2.3	Example Call Flow 2
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C provisions the quotas for URR1 and URR2 taking into account the credit pool quota and the multipliers of the RGs.  
This reflects another possible implementation option. This approach avoids extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is exhausted, and thus reduces Sxb signalling.

Figure C.2.2.3-2: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 2) 
1.	Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants: 
	RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP  included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
	RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP  included within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the multiplier (e.g. 0.5); 
2.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function, to create:
	A new URR1 for RG1, quota=600, Linked URR = URR3; 
A new URR2 for RG2, quota=120, Linked URR = URR3;
And new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with Multiplier 0.5.
	The UP function accepts the request.
NOTE 1: To avoid receiving usage report upon exceeding the original Quota for RG1 or RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.1 = 600 for RG1, assuming RG1 consumes the complete Quota for the pool; similarly, for RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.5 = 120;
3.	The URR3 always first reaches the Quota, e.g. when the URR1 has counted 400, and URR2 has counted 40, this results the counted usage for the Credit Pool U=400 x 0.1 + 40 x 0.5 = 60. So the UP function sends an PFCP Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports:
     -	for the URR3, generated due to that it has reached quota (60), 
-	for the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3 and 
-	for the URR2, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3. 
     The CP function sends the response message.
4.	The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.  
5.	The CP function sends an PFCP Session Modification Request to the UP function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
	URR1 for RG1, quota=70 / 0.1 = 700; 
URR2 for RG2, quota=70 / 0.5 = 140; 
URR3 for The Credit Pool, quota = 200 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 70.
