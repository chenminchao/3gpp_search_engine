The 3GPP core network charging\narchitecture and principles are specified in TS\u00a032.240\u00a0[1], which provides\nan umbrella for other charging management documents that specify:\n\n  -  the content of the CDRs per domain / subsystem / service (offline\n    charging);\n\n  -  the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem\n    /service (online charging);\n\n  -  the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains /\n    subsystems / services;\n\n  -  the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the\n    charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).\n\nThe complete document structure for the charging TSs is defined in TS\n32.240\u00a0[1].\n\nThe present document specifies the offline and online charging description\nfor the Packet Switched (PS) domain based on the functional stage 2\ndescription in TS 23.060 [201], TS 23.401 [208] and TS 23.402 [209].\nThe offline and online charging description for the PS domain encompasses\nalso fixed broadband access in the convergent scenario deployment (i.e.\nboth the fixed broadband access network and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) owned\nby a single operator) based on the functional stage 2 description in the\ncorresponding Annex of TS 23.203 [215].\n\nThis charging description includes the offline and online charging\narchitecture and scenarios specific to the PS domain, as well as the\nmapping of the common 3GPP charging architecture specified in TS 32.240 [1]\nonto the PS domain.\nIt further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline\ncharging, and the charging events for online charging. The present document\nis related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:\n\n  -  The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240 [1];\n\n  -  The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for the CDRs are\n    specified in TS 32.298 [51];\n\n  -  A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the\n    network is specified in TS 32.295 [54];\n\n  -  The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network to\n    the operator's Billing Domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation\n    device) is specified in TS 32.297 [52];\n\n  -  The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for PS domain offline and\n    online charging is specified in TS\u00a032.299 [50].\n\nNote that a CAMEL based prepaid function and protocol is also specified for\nthe PS domain (TS 23.078 [206] and TS\u00a029.078\u00a0[202]). CAMEL entities and\nfunctions are outside the scope of the present document.\n\nAll terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document,\nwhich are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in TR 21.905 [100]. Those\nthat are common across charging management in PS domains, services or\nsubsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240\u00a0[1] and are\ncopied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading. Finally,\nthose items that are specific to the present document are defined\nexclusively in the present document.\n\nFurthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS\n22.115 [101].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "References", "numbering": "2", "title_level": 0, "desc": "2  References\n\nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this\ntext, constitute provisions of the present document.\n\n  References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\n    edition number, version number, etc.) or non-specific.\n\n  For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.\n\n  -  For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

An\nintegrated CGF may support the Ga interface from other PCN/CDFs.\n\nIf the CDF is external to the PCN, the charging events are transferred from\nthe PCN to the CDF via the Rf interface specified in TS 32.299 [50].

For correlation of charging information for the whole\nPDN connection, this \"EPS default bearer charging identifier\" is shared by\nall these IP-CAN bearers charging sessions activated during this PDN\nconnection, as the \"PDN connection charging identifier\".\n\nFor PMIP based connectivity, an \"unique Charging Id\" is assigned by the P-\nGW for the PDN connection (i.e. as it would be one IP-CAN bearer).\n\nFor ABC by the TDF:\n\n  -  in case of GTP based connectivity, an \"EPS default bearer charging\n    identifier\",\n\n  -  in case of PMIP based connectivity, an \"unique Charging Id\"\n\nis assigned by the P-GW and transferred to the TDF via the PCRF for the TDF\nsession.\n\nDuring handover of a PDN connection between a GTP based connectivity\naccess, and a PMIP based connectivity access for the P-GW (and reversely),\nthe \"EPS default bearer charging identifier\" and the \"unique Charging Id\"\nrespectively, are maintained in order to ensure charging continuity for the\nwhole PDN connection over the different accesses.\nUpon handover from GTP based connectivity to PMIP based connectivity, the\npreviously assigned \"EPS default bearer charging identifier\" is used as the\n\"unique Charging Id\". Upon handover from PMIP based connectivity to GTP\nbased connectivity, the previously assigned \"unique Charging Id\" is used as\nthe \"EPS default bearer charging identifier\".\n\nDuring handover of a PDN connection between a GTP based connectivity 3GPP\naccess, and a S2a/S2b GTP based connectivity non-3GPP access for the P-GW\n(and reversely), the \"EPS default bearer charging identifier\" is maintained\nfor the default bearer, and the \"Charging Id\" is maintained for the handed-\nover dedicated bearers (i.e. bearer with the same QCI and ARP in source and\ntarget systems). Depending on the active PCC rules, establishment of new\ndedicated bearers may be required after the handover. In this case each new\ndedicated bearer is assigned with a new \"Charging Id\" as per normal\nprocedures.\n\nWhen multiple simultaneous PDN connections are established for a given APN,\neach PDN connection is associated with its own \"PDN connection charging\nidentifier\" or \"unique Charging Id\" and processed independently from the\nother PDN connections.\n\nWhen a \"MAPCON capable UE\", as defined in TS 23.402 [209], has simultaneous\nPDN connections through different access networks, each PDN connection is\nassociated with its own \"PDN connection charging identifier\" or \"unique\ncharging Id\" over the selected access for the PDN connection.When selective\ntransfer of PDN connections between the different accesses is performed,\neach PDN connection is transferred, as for a single PDN connection.\n\nWhen an \"IFOM capable UE\", as defined in TS 23.402 [209], is simultaneously\nconnected to 3GPP access and WLAN access for different IP flows within the\nsame PDN connection, each service data flow is uniquely identified by a PCC\nRule within the PDN connection.\n\nFor a PDN connection with NBIFOM support, a \"PDN connection charging\nidentifier\" is assigned for the PDN connection and is shared by all the IP-\nCAN bearers for the present as well as for any future accesses used during\nthe PDN connection. Additional IP-CAN bearers (i.e. dedicated bearers as\nwell as any additional default bearer in a new access) which may be\nactivated during this PDN connection, are each assigned with their own \"IP-\nCAN bearer charging identifier.\"\n\n\n\nThe \"PDN connection charging identifier\" shall remain unchanged and be used\nby all serving nodes for the entire IP-CAN session. When a serving node is\nchanged, e.g. when UE moves PDN connection between LTE and WLAN or when\nserving gateway relocation is performed, the individual bearer charging\nidentifiers shall be maintained as for a single-access PDN connection.\n\n\n\nWhen SIPTO function applies, as defined in TS 23.060 [201] and TS 23.401\n[208] the standard charging behaviour for PDN connection\nactivation/deactivation applies on the respective GW.\n\nFor inter-level correlation when charging per IP-CAN session is not active,\nthe charging identifier assigned to the specific bearer serves as the PS\ndomain access network charging identifier used for a dynamic PCC rule. For\ninter-level correlation when Charging per IP-CAN session is active, the\ncharging identifier assigned to the PDN connection serves as the PS domain\naccess network charging identifier used for a dynamic PCC rule. Transport\nof PS domain access network charging identifier to an external application\nfunction are specified in TS\u00a029.212\u00a0[216].\n\nWith NBIFOM, specific service data flows can be moved from one access to\nanother. The transfer of the service data flow to the other access causes\nit to be bound to another bearer (either existing or to be created). When\nCharging per IP-CAN session is not active, the flow is then using a bearer\nwith a charging identifier which would be different than that originally\nnotified to the application function for inter-level correlation. To\nmaintain a single access network charging identifier for inter-level\ncorrelation, when NBIFOM is accepted for a PDN connection, then the\ncharging identifier assigned to the PDN connection serves as the PS domain\naccess network charging identifier used for a dynamic PCC rule.\n\n  NOTE:  When Charging per IP-CAN session is active the \"PDN connection\n         charging identifier\" remains unchanged so the information provided\n         to the application function remains unchanged throughout the IP-CAN\n         session.\n\n\n\nFor non-IP data, the PDN connection established with an unique IP-CAN\nbearer as specified in TS 23.401 [208], is assigned with an \"unique\nCharging Id\" by the P-GW.\n\n\n5.1.4  UE presence in Presence Reporting Area (PRA)\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "Single Presence Reporting Area (PRA)", "numbering": "5.1.4.1", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.1.4.1  Single Presence Reporting Area (PRA)\n\nThe Single Presence Reporting Area is not supported.\n\nNon-support of single Presence Reporting Area is determined by the release\nincluded in Service-Context-Id AVP.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "Multiple Presence Reporting Areas (PRAs)", "numbering": "5.1.4.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "GPP PS Data Off", "numbering": "5.1.5", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.1.4.2  Multiple Presence Reporting Areas (PRAs)\n\nUE presence in multiple presence reporting area (s) charging information,\nas defined in TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[208] and TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[215], is collected for each UE\nby S-GWs, P-GWs which are serving that UE.\n\nDuring IP-CAN session establishment/modification, and independently from\nthe PCRF, the OCS may provide to the P-GW, a list of:\n\n  -  Presence Reporting Area (PRA) Identifiers to be activated for Core\n    Network pre-configured Presence Reporting Areas,\n\n  -  Presence Reporting Area (PRA) Identifiers and their elements for UE-\n    dedicated Presence Reporting Areas.\n\nBy providing the corresponding above lists in Presence-Reporting-Area-\nInformation AVP(s), the OCS subscribes to the notifications of change of UE\npresence status in the PRA(s) through the Trigger-Type AVP.

FBC is supported by the P-GW by the\nintegration of a PCEF. With PCEF, the normal IP-CAN bearer charging is\nenhanced by the capability to categorise the service data flows within IP-\nCAN bearer data traffic by rating group or combination of the rating group\nand service id, i.e., while there is only one uplink an one downlink data\nvolume count per IP-CAN bearer in IP-CAN bearer charging, FBC provides one\ncount per each rating group or combination of the rating group and service\nid. In case that sponsored connectivity level reporting is active, FBC\ncategorise within IP-CAN bearer data traffic by combination of rating\ngroup, sponsor identity and application service provider identity. The\nlevel of the reporting is defined per PCC rule.

PCC rules are used for this determination. One PCC rule\nidentifies service data flow to be measured but it can also include certain\ncharacteristics related to that service data flow.\n\nPCC rules can be activated, deactivated and modified any time during the IP-\nCAN bearer lifetime. PCC rule activation, deactivation and modification are\nnot chargeable events. However these PCC rule changes may lead to \"start of\nservice data flow\" and \"termination of service data flow\" chargeable\nevents.\n\nA PCC rule can contain e.g.:\n\n  -  service data flow template (service data flow filters or application\n    identifier) to identify packets belonging to certain service data flow,\n\n\n\n  -  charging method to identify whether online/offline/both/neither\n    charging interface is used,\n\n  -  measurement method for offline charging to identify whether\n    time/volume/events are measured for this service data flow,\n\n  -  Charging key (i.e. rating group) for that service data flow,\n\n  -  service identifier for that service data flow,\n\n  -  Sponsor Identifier (offline charging only),\n\n  -  Application Service Provider Identifier (offline charging only),\n\n  -  application function record information to correlate the measurement\n    with application level reports,\n\n  -  reporting level for the service data flow (rating group, combination\n    of the rating group and service id or combination of the rating group,\n    sponsor identity and application service provider identity),\n\n  -  precedence to the situations where two or more PCC rules are\n    overlapping,\n\n  -  allowed access type (for NBIFOM control) See clause 5.2.1.7A..\n\nPCC rules can be:\n\n  -  pre-defined in P-GW (can be activated either by the PCRF or PCEF\n    itself) or,\n\n  -  dynamically provisioned and activated by the PCRF over the Gx\n    interface.\n\nThis is specified in TS 23.203 [215] and TS 29.212 [216].\n\nAccording to TS 23.203 [215] , the PCRF can modify the following charging\ninformation in a dynamic PCC rule which is active in the PCEF: Charging\nkey, Service identifier, Sponsor Identifier, Application Service Provider\nIdentifier, Measurement method, and reporting level The PCRF can also\nmodify the allowed access type in the case of NBIFOM.. A change of any of\nthis charging or allowed access type information will trigger a \"start of\nservice data flow\" chargeable event when a valid counter does not exist\ncorresponding to that changed PCC rule. A change of any of this charging or\nallowed access type information will trigger a \"termination of service data\nflow\" chargeable event when this was the last active service data flow for\nthe counter corresponding to the original PCC rule.\n\nWhen the CDF is implemented as a separate entity,  all these FBC related\nchargeable events,  trigger charging events  reporting, for P-GW CDRs to be\nconstructed, enriched or closed by CDF, according to description in clause\n5.2.2.\n\nExtended packet inspection can be done in the PCEF with pre-defined PCC\nrules. The PCEF also have the possibility to output service specific\ninformation related to the packet inspection in the CDR.\n\nThe capability of P-GW to support ABC is achieved with PCRF providing\nappropriate PCC rules to the P-GW.

PCC rules are used for this determination. One PCC rule\nidentifies service data flow to be measured but it can also include certain\ncharacteristics related to that service data flow.\n\nPCC rules can be activated, deactivated and modified any time during the IP-\nCAN session lifetime.\nIP-CAN bearer deactivation also leads to deactivation of all PCC rules\nassociated with that bearer.\nPCC rule activation, deactivation and modification are not chargeable\nevents.\nHowever these PCC rule changes may lead to \"start of service data flow'\"and\n\"termination of service data flow'\" chargeable events.\n\nAccording to TS 23.203 [215], the PCRF can modify the following charging\ninformation in a dynamic PCC rule which is active in the PCEF: Charging\nkey, Service identifier, Sponsor Identifier, Application Service Provider\nIdentifier, IP-CAN types, Measurement method and reporting level. The PCRF\ncan also modify the allowed access type in the case of NBIFOM.\nA change of allowed access type in the case of NBIFOM will trigger an\n\"access change for service data flow\" chargeable event when all service\ndata flows for the associated counter are changed from one access to\nanother and takes priority over change of charging information.\nA change of any of this charging information will trigger a \"start of\nservice data flow'\" chargeable event when a valid counter does not exist\ncorresponding to that changed PCC rule.\nA change of any of this charging information will trigger a \"termination of\nservice data flow'\" chargeable event when this was the last active service\ndata flow for the counter corresponding to the original PCC rule.\n\nRemoval of an access from a PDN connection is not a trigger for FBC.\nSubsequent PCC rule handling, may lead to the \"access change for a service\ndata flow\" or \"termination of service data flow\" events for the service\ndata flows that were active on the removed access.\n\nExtended packet inspection can be done in the PCEF with pre-defined PCC\nrules.\nThe PCEF also have the possibility to output service specific information\nrelated to the packet inspection in the CDR.\n\nThe capability of P-GW to support ABC is achieved with PCRF providing\nappropriate PCC rules to the P-GW.

FBC is supported by the P-GW by the\nintegrated PCEF. When the PCEF is present, the normal IP-CAN bearer\ncharging is enhanced by the capability to categorise the service data flows\nwithin IP-CAN bearer data traffic by rating group or combination of the\nrating group and service id. I.e., while there is only one uplink and one\ndownlink data volume count per IP-CAN bearer in IP-CAN bearer charging, FBC\nmay provide one count per each rating group or combination of the rating\ngroup and service id. The level of the reporting is defined per PCC rule.\nDetails of this functionality are specified in TS\u00a023.203 [215] and TS\n32.240 [1].\n\n  NOTE:  The P-GW can only include one QoS Information occurrence per\n         Multiple Unit Operation.\n         This implies if an operator wishes to be able to separate usage\n         according to QCI and ARP within their charging system they will\n         need to ensure that services having different QCI and ARP do not\n         have the same:\n\n         -  rating group in cases where rating reporting is used;\n\n         -  rating group/service id where rating group/service id reporting\n           is used.\n\nExtended packet inspection can be done in the PCEF with pre-defined PCC\nrules. The PCEF also have the possibility to output service specific\ninformation related to the packet inspection in the online charging\ninformation.\n\nAn Application Function (AF) may provide an external charging identifier to\nbe delivered to the PCEF by the PCRF with a dynamic PCC rule. The PCEF\nincludes this AF correlation information in the online charging information\nfor the rating group and service identifier associated with the dynamic PCC\nrule when service identifier level reporting is requested.\n\nThe capability of P-GW to support ABC is achieved with PCRF providing\nappropriate PCC Rules to the P-GW. Such PCC Rule shall be defined with\nservice data flow template including an Application Identifier for the\napplication which needs to be detected, enforced and charged.\n\nAccording to TS 23.203 [215], FBC shall support different charging models\nper PCC rule. These charging models may be based on volume and/or time and\non number of events matching a specific service data flow template in PCC\nrule.\nIn general the charging of a service data flow shall be linked to the IP-\nCAN bearer under which the service data flow has been activated.  In online\ncharging the PCEF shall request the reservation of units  prior to service\ndelivery.\n\nThe following chargeable events are defined for FBC when online charging is\nactivated:\n\n  -  Network request for IP-CAN bearer activation before the Initiate IP-\n    CAN bearer Activation message is sent. Associated with the network\n    requested dedicated IP-CAN bearer activation procedure, as defined in\n    TS 23.203 [215] and TS 23.060 [201], upon encountering this event, a\n    Debit / Reserve Units Request[Initial], indicating the request for\n    activation of dedicated IP-CAN bearer is sent toward the OCS. For\n    network requested dedicated IP-CAN bearer activation, if known by the\n    PCEF, the PCEF may provide status of UE presence in Presence Reporting\n    Area(s).\n\n  -  Start of IP-CAN bearer. Upon encountering this event, a Debit /\n    Reserve Units Request[Initial], indicating the start of the IP-CAN\n    bearer, is sent towards the OCS to authorize the IP-CAN bearer. For\n    network requested dedicated IP-CAN bearer activation, this event\n    triggers a Debit / Reserve Units Request[Update], when the PCEF\n    receives an Update PDP Context Request message with the RAN Procedures\n    Ready flag. If known by the PCEF, the PCEF may provide status of UE\n    presence in Presence Reporting Area(s). PCEF may request quota later\n    when service usage is started.\n\n  -  Start of service data flow. In case valid quota does not exist a Debit\n    / Reserve Units Request[Update] is generated to request quota. In case\n    charging session does not exist, the request is a Debit/ Reserve Units\n    Request[Initial] sent towards the OCS.\n    The type of requested quota shall depend on measurement method\n    configured for the PCC rule in case of decentralized unit\n    determination. When event based charging applies, the first occurrence\n    of an event matching a service data flow template in PCC rule shall be\n    considered as the start of a service.\n\n  -  Termination of service data flow. If reporting is per rating group and\n    this is the last service data flow utilizing that specific rating group\n    or if reporting is per combination of the rating group and service id\n    and this is the last service data flow utilizing that specific rating\n    group and service id, the required counters are updated.\n    Termination of the service data flow itself does not trigger Debit /\n    Reserve Units Request[Update].\n\n  -- Access of a multi-access PDN connection becomes unusable: the\n    Termination of service data flow chargeable event applies for all the\n    service data flows carried under the IP-CAN bearer of the unusable\n    access.\n\n  -  Access of a multi-access PDN connection becomes usable: the Start of\n    service data flow chargeable event applies for all the service data\n    flows carried under the IP-CAN bearer of the access that has become\n    usable.\n\n  -  Expiry of Unused Quota timer for the charging session in PCEF, a Debit\n    / Reserve Units Request[Terminate] is sent to OCS indicating that\n    charging session is terminated, and the IP-CAN bearer is still active.\n    In this case the OCS shall allow for a new session to be started with\n    the same Charging Id.\n\n  -  End of IP-CAN bearer. Upon encountering this event, a Debit / Reserve\n    Units Request[Terminate], indicating the end of the IP-CAN bearer, is\n    sent towards the OCS together with the final counts.\n\n  -  Ro specific chargeable events (e.g. threshold reached, QHT expires,\n    quota exhaustion, validity time reached, forced re-authorization).\n    Corresponding counts for the rating group(s) are closed and Debit /\n    Reserve Units Request[Update] is triggered according the rules defined\n    in TS 32.299 [50].\n\n  -  Change of charging condition: E.g. QoS change, user location change,\n    user CSG information change, change of UE presence in Presence\n    Reporting Area(s), change of 3GPP PS Data Off status, Serving PLMN Rate\n    Control change, and APN Rate Control change.\n    When this event is encountered and the corresponding re-authorization\n    trigger is armed, all current counts are captured and sent towards the\n    OCS with a Debit / Reserve Units Request[Update].\n\n  -  Tariff time change. When this event is encountered, all current counts\n    are captured and a new counts are started. The counts are sent to the\n    OCS in next Debit / Reserve Units Request.\n\nManagement intervention may also force trigger a chargeable event.\n\nIf the PCEF supports the Unused Quota timer it may send its locally\nconfigured value to the OCS. The OCS may in this case respond with a new\nvalue of the Unused Quota timer to the PCEF, to be used instead of the PCEF\nconfigured value.\n\nPCC rules can be activated, deactivated and modified any time during the IP-\nCAN bearer lifetime. PCC rule activation, deactivation and modification are\nnot chargeable events.

Not all of the\ncharging information to be collected is static, and other charging\ninformation is directly dependent on dynamic Packet-Switched service usage.\n\nFBC online charging is employed if it is activated for the IP-CAN bearer.\nThe charging method in the PCC rule defines whether service data flow\nrequires the online charging. The PCEF shall request the quota prior to\nservice delivery.\nIf only certain quotas are authorised by the OCS (e.g. due to insufficient\ncredit), the rating groups for which no quota was authorised are handled\naccording the received Result Code value.

When Tx expires, P-GW/TDF shall\nexecute the Failover and Failure Handling mechanisms according to the\nbehaviour described in Annex B.\n\nThree different actions are described in RFC 4006 [402].\n\nP-GW shall support the following actions when the failure handling\nmechanism is executed:\n\n  -  Terminate: The online session is finished. The associated IP-CAN\n    bearer session is released (ongoing sessions) or not established (new\n    sessions). Failover for ongoing sessions is not supported. Failover for\n    new sessions is always supported.\n\n  -  Retry&Terminate: The online session is finished. The associated IP-CAN\n    bearer session is released (ongoing sessions) or not established (new\n    sessions). Failover for ongoing sessions is supported. Failover for new\n    sessions is always supported.\n\n  -  Continue: The online session is finished. The associated IP-CAN bearer\n    session is established (new sessions) or not released (ongoing\n    sessions). Failover for ongoing sessions is supported. Failover for new\n    sessions is always supported. It shall be operator configurable to\n    limit the maximum duration of the IP-CAN bearer in this situation.\n\nWhen charging per IP-CAN session is active, the actions above apply to the\nentire IP-CAN session instead of the individual IP-CAN bearer.\n\nTDF shall support the following actions when the failure handling mechanism\nis based on the directives received previously from the OCS:\n\n  -  Terminate: This is the default behaviour. The TDF indicates to the\n    PCRF that the charging session was terminated and the OCS does not\n    allow the service to continue. The PCRF determines whether to continue\n    or terminate the associated TDF session.\n\n  -  Retry&Terminate: If the OCS and TDF support failover procedures and\n    there is an alternate OCS available, the TDF shall attempt to failover\n    to an alternative OCS. Otherwise, the TDF indicates to the PCRF that\n    the charging session was terminated and the OCS does not allow the\n    service to continue. The PCRF determines whether to continue or\n    terminate the associated TDF session.\n\n  -  Continue: If the OCS and TDF support failover procedures and there is\n    an alternate OCS available, the TDF shall attempt to failover to an\n    alternative OCS. Otherwise, the TDF indicates to the PCRF that the\n    charging session was terminated and the OCS allows the service to\n    continue. The PCRF determines whether to continue or terminate the\n    associated TDF session.\n\nIn case the user is simultaneously online and offline charged, the failure\nsituation must be registered in the PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR. When the user is only\nonline charged, the execution of the Failure Handling mechanism with value\nequal to Continue shall imply that a new PGW-CDR/TDF-CDR is opened.\n\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "Definition of charging information", "numbering": "6", "title_level": 0, "desc": "         6  Definition of charging information\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "Rf message content", "numbering": "6.1A", "title_level": 1, "desc": "6.1A Rf message content\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "General", "numbering": "6.1A.0", "title_level": 2, "desc": "6.1A.0 General\n\nThis clause is applicable to the ePDG, TWAG, MME, S-GW, P-GW and TDF, when\nthe CDF is provided as an external entity.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "GSM, UMTS, LTE, charging, management, packet switched"}, {"key": "Summary of offline charging message formats", "numbering": "6.1A.1", "title_level": 2, "desc": "6.1A.1 Summary of offline charging message formats\n\nThe PS Offline Charging and \"\"SMS over MME Charging\" utilises the Charging\nData Transfer that is specified in the 3GPP accounting application\ndescribed in TS\u00a032.299 [50].\n\nThe Charging Data Transfer operation employs the Charging Data Request and\nCharging Data Response messages.\n\nThe Charging Data Request can be of type [Start, Interim, Stop and Event]\nand includes all charging information.
