Both rating and unit determination can be implemented\ncentralized, i.e. on the OCF, or decentralized, that is, on the CTF.\n\nUnit determination refers to the calculation of the number of non-monetary\nunits (service units, data volume, time and events) that shall be assigned\nprior to starting service delivery.\n\n  -  With Centralized Unit Determination, the OCF determines the number of\n    non-monetary units that a certain service user can consume based on a\n    service key received from the CTF.\n\n  -  With the Decentralized Unit Determination approach, the CTF determines\n    itself how many units are required to start service delivery, and\n    requests these units from the OCF.\n\nAfter checking the service user's account balance, the OCF returns the\nnumber of granted units to the CTF. The CTF is then responsible for the\nsupervision of service delivery. Particularly, the CTF shall limit service\ndelivery to the corresponding number of granted units.\n\nRating refers to the calculation of a price out of the non-monetary units\ncalculated by the unit determination function.\n\n  -  With the Centralized Rating approach, the CTF and the OCF exchange\n    information about non-monetary units. The OCF translates these units\n    into monetary units.\n\n  -  With the Decentralized Rating approach, the corresponding rating\n    control is performed within the CTF. Consequently, CTF and OCF exchange\n    information about monetary units.\n\nThree cases for online charging can be distinguished: Immediate Event\nCharging (IEC), Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) and Session\nCharging with Unit Reservation (SCUR).

The CDF uses this information to\nconstruct and format CDRs. The above-mentioned reference points are defined\nin TS 32.240 [1].\n\nA configurable timer is supported in the CDF to supervise the reception of\nthe ACR[Interim] and/or ACR[Stop]. An instance of the \"Timer\" is started at\nthe beginning of the accounting session, reset on the receipt of an\nACR[Interim] and stopped at the reception of the ACR[Stop]. Upon expiration\nof the timer, the CDF stops the accounting session with the appropriate\nerror indication.\n\nFor offline charging, the CTF implements the accounting state machine\ndescribed in RFC 6733 [401].\nThe server (CDF) implements the accounting state machine \"SERVER, STATELESS\nACCOUNTING\" as specified in RFC 6733 [401], i.e. there is no order in which\nthe server expects to receive the accounting information.\n\nThe offline charging functionality is based on the Network Elements\nreporting accounting information upon reception of various messages which\ntrigger charging generation, as most of the accounting relevant information\nis contained in these messages. This reporting is achieved by sending\nDiameter Accounting Requests (ACR) [start, interim, stop and event] from\nthe Network Elements to the CDF.\n\nFollowing the Diameter base protocol specification, the following \"types\"\nof accounting data may be sent with regard to offline charging:\n\n 1. START session accounting data.\n\n 2. INTERIM session accounting data.\n\n 3. STOP session accounting data.\n\n 4. EVENT accounting data.\n\nTwo cases are currently distinguished for offline charging purposes:\n\n 5. Event based charging; and\n\n 6. Session based charging.\n\nACR types START, INTERIM and STOP are used for accounting data related to\nsuccessful sessions. In contrast, EVENT accounting data is unrelated to\nsessions, and is used e.g. for a simple registration or interrogation and\nsuccessful service event triggered by a Network Element. In addition, EVENT\naccounting data is also used for unsuccessful session establishment\nattempts.\n\nThe flows and scenarios for the above two described cases are further\ndetailed below.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "charging, management, protocol, Diameter"}, {"key": "Event based charging", "numbering": "6.1.1", "title_level": 2, "desc": "6.1.1  Event based charging\n\nIn the case of event based charging, the network reports the usage or the\nservice rendered where the service offering is rendered in a single\noperation.

The Network Element receives a session initiation. The session\n       initiation may be done either by the user or the other Network\n       Element.\n\n  Step 2.  In order to perform Reserve Units operation for a number of\n       units (monetary or non-monetary units), the Network Element sends a\n       CCR with CC-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the OCS. If\n       known, the Network Element may include Requested-Service-Unit (RSU)\n       AVP (monetary or non monetary units) in the request message.\n\n  Step 3.  If the service cost information is not received by the OCS, the\n       OCS determines the price of the desired service according to the\n       service specific information received by issuing a rating request to\n       the Rating Function. If the cost of the service is included in the\n       request, the OCS directly reserves the specified monetary amount. If\n       the credit balance is sufficient, the OCS reserves the corresponding\n       amount from the users account.\n\n  Step 4.  Once the reservation has been made, the OCS returns CCA message\n       with CC-Request-Type set to INITIAL_REQUEST to the Network Element in\n       order to authorize the service execution (Granted-Service-Unit and\n       possibly Cost-Information indicating the cost of the service and\n       Remaining-Balance AVP are included in the CCA message).  The OCS may\n       return the Validity-Time (VT) AVP with value field set to a non-zero\n       value.

Content/service delivery starts and the reserved units are\n       concurrently controlled.\n\n  Step 6.  During session delivery, in order to perform Debit Units and\n       subsequent Reserve Units operations, the Network Element sends a CCR\n       with CC-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST, to report the units\n       used and request additional units, respectively. The CCR message with\n       CC-Request-Type AVP set to UPDATE_REQUEST shall be sent by the\n       Network Element between the INITIAL_REQUEST and TERMINATION_REQUEST\n       either on request of the Credit-Control application within the\n       validity time or if the validity time is elapsed. If known, the\n       Network Element may include Requested-Service-Unit AVP (monetary or\n       non monetary units) in the request message.

The OCS deducts the amount used from the account. If the service\n       cost information is not received by the OCS, the OCS determines the\n       price of the desired service according to the service specific\n       information received by issuing a rating request to the Rating\n       Function. If the cost of the service is included in the request, the\n       OCS directly reserves the specified monetary amount. If the credit\n       balance is sufficient, the OCS reserves the corresponding amount from\n       the users account.\n\n  Step 8.  Once the deduction and reservation have been made, the OCS\n       returns CCA message with CC-Request-Type set to UPDATE_REQUEST to the\n       Network Element, in order to allow the content/service delivery to\n       continue (new Granted-Service-Unit (GSU) AVP and possibly Cost-\n       Information (CI) AVP indicating the cumulative cost of the service\n       and Remaining-Balance AVP are included in the CCA message). The OCS\n       may include in the CCA message the Final-Unit-Indication (FUI) AVP to\n       indicate the final granted units. The OCS may indicate in the Low-\n       Balance-Indication AVP that the subscriber account balance has fallen\n       below a predefined threshold of this account.\n\n  Step 9.  Session delivery continues and the reserved units are\n       concurrently controlled.\n\n  Step 10. The session is terminated at the Network Element.\n\n  Step 11.    The Network Element sends CCR with CC-Request-Type AVP set to\n       TERMINATION_REQUEST to terminate the active Credit-Control session\n       and report the used units.\n\n  Step 12.
