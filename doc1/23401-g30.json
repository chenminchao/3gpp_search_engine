The Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain\nprovides IP connectivity using the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio\nAccess Network (E-UTRAN).\n\nThe specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios and covers\nall aspects, including mobility between E-UTRAN and pre-E-UTRAN 3GPP radio\naccess technologies, policy control and charging, and authentication.\n\nThe Radio Access Network functionality is documented only to the extent\nnecessary to describe the overall system. TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] contains the\noverall description of the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-\nUTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).\n\nITU-T Recommendation I.130\u00a0[3] describes a three-stage method for\ncharacterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU-T Recommendation\nQ.65\u00a0[4] defines Stage\u00a02 of the method.\n\nTS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2] is a companion specification to this specification.\n\nAn Evolved Packet System architecture optimised for the support of Cellular\nIoT (Internet of Things) applications is also defined in this document.\n\nThe Evolved Packet System also provides support for the E-UTRAN to control\na Dual Connectivity radio connection that uses a combination of E-UTRA and\nanother radio access technology (e.g. NR). TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] contains the\noverall description for Dual Connectivity.\n\nEnhancements to support interworking of EPS with 5GS are captured in\nTS\u00a023.501\u00a0[83] and TS\u00a023.502\u00a0[84].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "References", "numbering": "2", "title_level": 0, "desc": "2  References\n\nThe following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this\ntext, constitute provisions of the present document.\n\n  -  References are either specific (identified by date of publication,\n    edition number, version number, etc.) or non-specific.\n\n  -  For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.\n\n  -  For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies.

The E-\nUTRAN architecture and related functions to support Dual Connectivity with\nE-UTRAN is further described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. Dual Connectivity with E-\nUTRAN as Master RAN node and NR as Secondary RAN node is further described\nin TS\u00a037.340\u00a0[85].\n\nDual connectivity defines \"Master Cell Group (MCG) bearer\" and \"Secondary\nCell Group (SCG) bearer\" alternatives (see TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]). For E-RABs\nconfigured as \"MCG bearers\" the U-plane termination points are maintained,\nwhereas for E-RABs configured as \"SCG bearers\" it enables changing the U-\nplane termination point in the E-UTRAN by means of S1-MME signalling\nwithout changing the S1-MME termination point.\n\nDual Connectivity also defines a \"split bearer\" alternative TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\nThe \"split bearer\" in the E-UTRAN is transparent to the core network\nentities (e.g. MME, S-GW etc.) with the exception of the CSG membership\nverification by the MME when the Secondary eNB is a hybrid access eNB.\n\nThe E-UTRAN uses the per-UE information supplied by the MME and local E-\nUTRAN configuration data to determine whether or not to use Dual\nConnectivity for that UE, and, on a per EPS bearer basis the E-UTRAN\ndecides whether to use an MCG bearer or SCG bearer, and, whether or not\nthat bearer is a \"split bearer\".\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Typically, the MME and SGW cannot determine whether the RAN\n         termination point(s) for the S1-U interface are located on a Master\n         RAN node that has multiple IP addresses, or, on a Secondary RAN\n         node.\n\nIf the UE has indicated support for Dual Connectivity with NR and MME has\nan Access Restriction for NR for a UE (either signalled from the HSS, or,\nlocally generated by VPLMN policy in the MME) then the MME shall signal\nthis to the E-UTRAN as part of Handover Restriction List and to the UE in\nAttach and TAU Accept as defined in clauses 5.5.2.2.3, 5.5.2.4.3, 5.3.2.1,\n5.3.3.1, 5.3.3.2 and D.3.6 respectively.\n\nAn eNB supporting Dual Connectivity with NR checks whether the UE is\nallowed to use NR.

Another example is\n         the selection of an RFSP value that prevents idle mode camping on\n         2G for a UE provisioned with \"IMS PS voice preferred, CS Voice as\n         secondary\" if other RATs supporting IMS Voice are available, as the\n         UE would in such case always select the CS domain for its voice\n         calls.\n\n  -  the ARPI In Use is identical to the subscribed ARPI, or\n\n  -  the MME chooses the ARPI in use based on the subscribed ARPI, the\n    locally configured operator's policies and the UE related context\n    information available at the MME.\n\nFor roaming subscribers the MME may alternatively choose the RFSP Index and\nARPI in use based on the visited network policy, but can take input from\nthe HPLMN into account (e.g., an RFSP Index value/ARPI value pre-configured\nper HPLMN, or a single RFSP Index value/single ARPI value to be used for\nall roamers independent of the HPLMN).\n\nThe MME forwards the RFSP Index and ARPI in use to the eNodeB across S1.\nThe RFSP Index and ARPI in use is also forwarded from source eNodeB to\ntarget eNodeB when X2 is used for intra-E-UTRAN handover, UE context\nretrieval, or, Dual Connectivity with a secondary RAN node.\n\nThe MME stores the subscribed RFSP Index and ARPI values received from the\nHSS and the RFSP Index and ARPI values in use. During the Tracking Area\nUpdate procedure, the MME may update the RFSP Index/ARPI value in use (e.g.\nthe MME may need to update the RFSP Index/ARPI value in use if the UE\nrelated context information in the MME has changed). When the RFSP\nIndex/ARPI value in use is changed, the MME immediately provides the\nupdated RFSP Index/ARPI value in use to eNodeB by modifying an existing UE\ncontext or by establishing an new UE context in the eNodeB or by being\nconfigured to include the updated RFSP Index/ARPI value in use in the\nDOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message if the user plane establishment is not\nneeded. During inter-MME mobility procedures, the source MME forwards both\nRFSP Index values and both ARPI values to the target MME. The target MME\nmay replace the received RFSP Index and ARPI values in use with a new RFSP\nIndex value in use or new ARPI value in use that is based on the operator's\npolicies and the UE related context information available at the target\nMME.\n\nThe S1 messages that transfer the RFSP Index and ARPI to the eNodeB are\nspecified in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36].

This is achieved by setting a Weight\nFactor for each MME, such that the probability of the eNodeB selecting an\nMME is proportional to its Weight Factor. The Weight Factor is typically\nset according to the capacity of an MME node relative to other MME nodes.\nThe Weight Factor is sent from the MME to the eNodeB via S1-AP messages\n(see TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]). If a HeNB GW is deployed, the Weight Factor is sent\nfrom the MME to the HeNB GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  An operator may decide to change the Weight Factor after the\n         establishment of S1-MME connectivity as a result of changes in the\n         MME capacities.

When an MME serves multiple DCNs and one DCN\nis supported by multiple MMEs, in order to achieve load balancing across\nthe MMEs of the same MME pool area supporting the same DCN, each DCN\nsupported by this MME may have its own Weight Factor (Weight Factor per\nDCN).

Gradual rather than sudden off-loading should be performed as\na sudden re-balance of large number of subscribers could overload other\nMMEs in the pool. With minimal impact on network and the user's experience,\nthe subscribers should be off-loaded as soon as possible). The load re-\nbalancing can off-load part of or all the subscribers.\n\nTo off-load ECM-CONNECTED mode UEs, the MME initiates the S1 Release\nprocedure with release cause \"load balancing TAU required\" (clause 5.3.5).\nThe S1 and RRC connections are released and the UE initiates a TAU but\nprovides neither the S-TMSI nor the GUMMEI to eNodeB in the RRC\nestablishment.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Special care needs to be taken when offloading Relay Nodes.

The MME may wait until\nthe S1 Release is performed due to inactivity.

Typically such failures should result in alarms which\nalert the operator/O+M system. Only if the operator/O+M system is sure that\nthere is spare capacity in the rest of the pool, the operator/O+M system\nmight use the load re-balancing procedure to move some load off this MME.\nHowever, extreme care is needed to ensure that this load re-balancing does\nnot overload other MMEs within the pool area (or neighbouring SGSNs) as\nthis might lead to a much wider system failure.\n\nWhen the Dedicated Core Network (DCN) feature is used, the DCN load re-\nbalancing functionality permits UEs that are registered on an MME in the\nDCN (within a pool area) to be moved to another MME in the same DCN in a\nmanner that achieves load balancing between the CN nodes of the DCN and\npool area. The DCN load re-balancing is triggered by the source MME (within\na DCN). The details are as follows:\n\n  -  If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state, the NAS Message Redirection procedure\n    (see clause\u00a05.19.1) is triggered at the next intra-MME Tracking Area\n    Update Request enabling eNodeB to load balance between MMEs of the same\n    DCN. To off-load UEs in ECM-IDLE state without waiting for the UE to\n    perform a TAU or perform Service request, the MME first pages the UE to\n    bring it to ECM-CONNECTED state and proceeds as decribed for the ECM-\n    CONNECTED case below.\n\n  -  If the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED state, the MME performs the GUTI\n    reallocation procedure, includes the unchanged GUTI of the UE and a non-\n    broadcast TAI to induce the UE to peform a TAU procedure, and forces\n    the UE to go to ECM-IDLE state.

The Session\nManagement congestion control does not prevent the UE to send and receive\ndata or initiate Service Request procedures for activating user plane\nbearers towards the APN(s) that are under ESM congestion control.\n\n\n4.3.7.4.2.3 APN based Mobility Management congestion control\n\nThe MME may perform the APN based congestion control for UEs with a\nparticular subscribed APN by rejecting Attach procedures with a Mobility\nManagement back-off timer.\n\nWhen congestion control is active for UEs with a particular subscribed APN,\na Mobility Management back-off timer may be sent by the MME to UE.\n\nIf MME maintains the UE context, the MME may store the back-off time per UE\nif a request without the low access priority indicator is rejected by the\nMME. The MME may immediately reject any subsequent request from the UE\nbefore the stored back-off time is expired.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The above functionality is to diminish the performance advantage\n         for UEs that do not support the NAS level back-off timer (e.g. pre-\n         Rel-10 UEs) compared to UEs that do support it.\n\nAfter rejecting Attach Requests, the MME should keep the Subscriber Data\nfor some time. This allows for rejection of subsequent requests without HSS\nsignalling when the congestion situation resulting from UEs with a\nparticular subscribed APN persists.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  Prior to the reject of attach messages of a UE by the MME,\n         Subscriber Data for a UE may be present at the MME because it was\n         not deleted after the UE's detach. In this case when APN based\n         congestion control is active for a particular APN in the MME, the\n         first reject of an attach message by the MME for this UE, may be\n         done without HSS signaling as well.\n\nWhile the Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the UE shall not\ninitiate any NAS request for Mobility Management procedures. However, the\nUE is allowed to initiate the Mobility Management procedures for high\npriority access and emergency services even when the Mobility Management\nback-off timer is running. While the Mobility Management back-off timer is\nrunning, the UE is allowed to perform Tracking Area Update if it is already\nin connected mode.\n\nWhile the Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the UE configured\nwith a permission for overriding low access priority is allowed to initiate\nthe Mobility Management procedures without low access priority if the\nMobility Management back-off timer was started due to a reject message\nreceived in response to a request with low access priority and the upper\nlayers in the UE request to activate a PDN connection without low access\npriority or the UE has an activated PDN connection that is not with low\naccess priority.\n\nTo avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)\nsimultaneously, the MME should select the Mobility Management back-off\ntimer value so that deferred requests are not synchronized.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  When receiving the Mobility Management back-off timer the UE\n         behaviour is not APN specific.\n\n\n4.3.7.4.2.4 General NAS level Mobility Management congestion control\n\nUnder general overload conditions the MME may reject Mobility Management\nsignalling requests from UEs. When a NAS request is rejected, a Mobility\nManagement back-off timer may be sent by the MME and MME may store the back-\noff time per UE if a request without the low access priority indicator is\nrejected by the MME and if MME maintains the UE context. The MME may\nimmediately reject any subsequent request from the UE before the stored\nback-off time is expired. While the Mobility Management back-off timer is\nrunning, the UE shall not initiate any NAS request for Mobility Management\nprocedures except for Detach procedure and except for high priority access,\nemergency services and mobile terminated services. After any such Detach\nprocedure, the back-off timer continues to run. While the Mobility\nManagement back-off timer is running, the UE is allowed to perform Tracking\nArea Update if it is already in connected mode. If the UE receives a paging\nrequest from the MME while the Mobility Management back off timer is\nrunning, the UE shall stop the Mobility Management back-off timer and\ninitiate the Service Request procedure or the Tracking Area Update\nprocedure as described in clause\u00a05.3.3.0.\n\nWhile the Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the UE configured\nwith a permission for overriding low access priority is allowed to initiate\nthe Mobility Management procedures without low access priority if the\nMobility Management back-off timer was started due to a reject message\nreceived in response to a request with low access priority and the upper\nlayers in UE request to establish a PDN connection without low access\npriority or the UE has an established PDN connection that is without low\naccess priority.\n\nWhile the Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the UE configured\nwith permission for sending exception reporting is allowed to initiate the\nControl Plane Service Request procedure for exception reporting. If the\nMobility Management back-off timer was started due to a reject message\nreceived in response to a request for exception reporting, the UE shall not\ninitiate the Control Plane Service Request procedure for exception\nreporting while the Mobility Management back-off timer is running.\n\nThe Mobility Management back-off timer shall not impact Cell/RAT and PLMN\nchange. Cell/RAT and TA change do not stop the Mobility Management back-off\ntimer. The Mobility Management back-off timer shall not be a trigger for\nPLMN reselection. The back-off timer is stopped as defined in\nTS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46] when a new PLMN that is not an equivalent PLMN is accessed.\n\nTo avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)\nsimultaneously, the MME should select the Mobility Management back-off\ntimer value so that the deferred requests are not synchronized.\n\nWhen the UE receives a handover command, the UE shall proceed with the\nhandover procedure regardless of whether Mobility Management back-off timer\nis running.\n\nThe MME should not reject Tracking Area Update procedures that are\nperformed when the UE is already in connected mode.\n\nFor idle mode inter CN node mobility, the MME may reject Tracking Area\nUpdate procedures and include a Mobility Management back off timer value in\nthe Tracking Area Reject message.\n\nIf the MME rejects Tracking Area Update request or Service request with a\nMobility Management back-off timer which is larger than the sum of the UE's\nperiodic TAU timer plus the Implicit Detach timer, the MME should adjust\nthe mobile reachable timer and/or Implicit Detach timer such that the MME\ndoes not implicitly detach the UE while the Mobility Management back-off\ntimer is running.\n\n  NOTE:  This is to minimize unneeded signalling after the Mobility\n         Management back-off timer expires.\n\n\n4.3.7.4.2.5 Group specific NAS level congestion control\n\nThe group specific NAS level congestion control applies to a specific group\nof UEs. Each group has a group identifier assigned.\n\nA UE belongs to a group, if the corresponding group identifier is stored in\nthe UE's subscription data in the HSS. A UE may belong to multiple groups\nand the MME may perform the Group specific NAS level congestion control to\nan UE as described below independent of whether Group specific NAS level\ncongestion control is activated for one, multiple, or all groups the UE\nbelongs to. The group identifier shall be stored per UE in the HSS and\nobtained by the MME as part of normal HSS signalling. A UE is not aware of\na group subscription.\n\nThe group specific NAS level congestion control may be activated for\nSession Management signalling, or for Mobility Management signalling, or\nboth. The group specific NAS level congestion control is activated based on\noperator policies.\n\nWhen the group specific NAS level congestion control for Session Management\nsignalling is active for a particular group, the MME's behaviour is similar\nto that in clause\u00a04.3.7.4.2.2, with the following modifications:\n\n  -  MME may apply ESM congestion control to all subscribed APNs for UEs\n    that belong to this particular group.\n\n  NOTE:  How the MME applies ESM congestion control to all subscribed APNs\n         is left to Stage 3.\n\n  -  The MME rejects the EPS Session Management (ESM) request(s) from the\n    UE belonging to this particular group (e.g. PDN Connectivity, or Bearer\n    Resource Allocation Requests) with a Session Management back-off timer.\n\nWhen group specific NAS level congestion control for Mobility Management\nsignalling is active for a particular group, the MME's behaviour is similar\nto that in clause\u00a04.3.7.4.2.3, but applied to UEs subscribed to this\nparticular group rather that subscribed to a particular APN.\n\nGroup specific NAS level congestion control is performed at the MME based\non the UE's subscription information provided by the HSS. There is no\nimpact on the UE, and hence, UE's behaviour as described in clauses\n4.3.7.4.2.2 and 4.3.7.4.2.3 does not change.\n\n\n4.3.7.4.2.6 APN and group specific NAS level congestion control\n\nThe APN and group specific NAS level congestion control is the\ninterclause\u00a0of APN specific NAS level congestion control and Group specific\nNAS level congestion control, i.e. it applies to a specific group of UEs\nwith a particular subscribed APN. Each group of UEs has a group identifier\nassigned and stored in the HSS.\n\nA UE may belong to multiple groups and the MME may perform the APN and\ngroup specific NAS level congestion control to an UE as described below\nindependent of whether the APN and group specific NAS level congestion\ncontrol is activated for one, multiple or all groups the UE belongs to. The\ngroup identifier(s) shall be stored per UE in the HSS and obtained by the\nMME as part of normal HSS signalling. A UE is not aware of the group\nidentifier(s) that the UE belongs to.\n\nThe APN and group specific NAS level congestion control may be activated\nfor Session Management signalling, or for Mobility Management signalling,\nor both. The APN and group specific NAS level congestion control is\nactivated based on operator policies.\n\nWhen the APN and group specific NAS level congestion control for Session\nManagement signalling is activated for a UE belonging to a particular group\nand initiating signalling to a particular APN, the MME's behaviour is\nsimilar to that in clause\u00a04.3.7.4.2.2, with the following modifications:\n\n  -  The EPS Session Management (ESM) congestion control is applied to this\n    particular APN, and for UEs belonging to this particular group,\n\n  -  The MME may reject ESM requests from the UEs belonging to this\n    particular group and attaching to this particular APN (e.g. PDN\n    Connectivity, or Bearer Resource Allocation Requests) with a Session\n    Management back-off timer. If the UE provides no APN, then the MME uses\n    the APN which is used in PDN GW selection procedure.\n\n  -  The MME may deactivate PDN connections of the UEs, belonging to this\n    particular group and attaching to this particular APN, by sending the\n    NAS Deactivate EPS Bearer Context Request message to the UE with a\n    Session Management back-off timer.\n\nWhen the APN and group specific NAS level congestion control for Mobility\nManagement signalling is activated for a UE belonging to a particular group\nand with a particular subscribed APN, the MME's behaviour is similar to\nthat in clause\u00a04.3.7.4.2.3, but applied to UEs with this particular\nsubscribed APN and belonging to this particular group.\n\nAPN and group specific NAS level congestion control is performed at the MME\nbased on the UE's subscription information provided by the HSS. There is no\nimpact on the UE, and hence, UE's behaviour described in\nclauses\u00a04.3.7.4.2.2 and 4.3.7.4.2.3 does not change.\n\n\n4.3.7.4.2.7 Control Plane data specific NAS level congestion control\n\nUnder overload conditions the MME may restrict requests from UEs for data\ntransmission via Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation. A Control Plane data\nback-off timer may be returned by the MME (e.g.in Attach/TAU/RAU Accept\nmessages, Service Reject message or Service Accept message). While the\nControl Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE shall not initiate any\ndata transfer via Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, i.e. the UE shall\nnot send any Control Plane Service Request with ESM Data Transport message\nas defined in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46]. The MME shall store the Control Plane data\nback-off timer per UE and shall reject any further request (other than\nexception reporting and a response to paging) for data transmission via\nControl Plane Service Request from that UE while the Control Plane data\nback-off timer is still running.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The Control Plane data back-off timer does not affect any other\n         mobility management or session management procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The Control Plane data back-off timer does not apply to user\n         plane data communication.\n\nIf the UE is allowed to send exception reporting, the UE may initiate\nControl Plane Service Request for exception reporting even if Control Plane\ndata back-off timer is running.\n\nThe UE may respond with Control Plane Service Request without ESM Data\nTransport to a paging even if the Control Plane data back-off timer is\nrunning.\n\nIf the MME receives a Control Plane Service Request in reponse to paging,\nand the MME has a Control Plane data back-off timer running for the UE, and\nthe MME is not overloaded, and MME decides to accept the Control Plane\nService Request, then the MME shall respond with Service Accept message\nwithout the Control Plane data back-off timer and stop the Control Plane\ndata back-off timer. If the UE receives a Service Accept message without\nthe Control Plane data back-off timer from the MME while the Control Plane\ndata back-off timer is running, the UE shall stop the Control Plane data\nback-off timer. The Control Plane data back-off timer in the UE and the MME\nis stopped at PLMN change.\n\nIf the MME receives a Control Plane Service Request with ESM Data Transport\nmessage, and decides to send the UE a Control Plane data back-off timer,\nthe MME may decide to process the Control Plane Service Request with ESM\nData Transport message, i.e. decrypt and forward the data payload, or not\nbased on the following:\n\n  -  If the UE has additionally indicated in a NAS Release Assistance\n    Information in the NAS PDU that no further Uplink or Downlink Data\n    transmissions are expected, then the MME may process (integrity\n    check/decipher/forward) the received Control Plane data packet, and\n    send SERVICE ACCEPT to the UE with Control Plane data back-off timer.\n    The UE interprets this as successful transmission of the Control Plane\n    data packet and  starts the Control Plane data back-off timer.\n\n  -  For all other cases, the MME may decide to not process the received\n    control plane data packet and sends SERVICE REJECT to the UE with\n    Control Plane data back-off timer. The UE interprets this indication as\n    unsuccessful delivery of the control plane data packet and  starts the\n    Control Plane data back-off timer. Then MME may take into consideration\n    whether the PDN Connection is set to Control Plane only to make the\n    decision whether to reject the packet and send SERVICE REJECT or move\n    the PDN connection to user plane and process the data packet.\n\n  -  Alternatively, if UE has not provided in the in Control Plane service\n    request the NAS Release Assistance Information, and the EPS bearer\n    belongs to a PDN connection not set to Control Plane only, and UE\n    supports User Plane CIoT Optimisation (or legacy S1-U), then the MME\n    may initiate establishment of S1-U bearer during Data Transport in\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation (according to the procedure defined\n    in clause\u00a05.3.4B.4). In this case MME may also return a Control Plane\n    data back-off timer within the NAS message.\n\nThe MME only includes the Control Plane data back-off timer if the UE has\nindicated support for Control Plane data back-off timer in the\nAttach/TAU/RAU request.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If the MME is overloaded or close to overload, but the UE has\n         not indicated support for Control Plane data back-off timer, the\n         MME can use other overload control mechanisms, e.g. mobility\n         management back-off timer or use user plane data communication.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "PDN GW control of overload", "numbering": "4.3.7.5", "title_level": 3, "desc": "4.3.7.5  PDN GW control of overload\n\nThe PDN GW may provide mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload\nsituations.

If no L-GW address\nis proposed by the HeNB and the UE requested an APN with LIPA permissions\nset to \"LIPA-only\", the request shall be rejected. If no L-GW address is\nproposed by the HeNB and the UE requested an APN with LIPA permissions set\nto \"LIPA-conditional\", the MME uses DNS interrogation for PDN GW selection\nto establish a non-LIPA PDN connection. The PDN subscription context for an\nAPN with LIPA permissions set to \"LIPA-only\" shall not contain a statically\nconfigured PDN address or a statically allocated PDN GW. A static PDN\naddress or a static PDN GW address, if configured by HSS for an APN with\nLIPA permissions set to \"LIPA-conditional\", is ignored by MME when the APN\nis established as a LIPA PDN connection. When establishing a PDN connection\nfor a LIPA APN, the VPLMN Address Allowed flag is not considered.\n\nThe PDN GW domain name shall be constructed and resolved by the method\ndescribed in TS\u00a029.303\u00a0[61], which takes into account any value received in\nthe APN-OI Replacement field for home routed traffic. Otherwise, or when\nthe resolution of the above PDN GW domain name fails, the PDN GW domain\nname shall be constructed by the serving node using the method specified in\nAnnex\u00a0A of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] and clause\u00a09 of TS\u00a023.003\u00a0[9]. If the Domain Name\nService function provides a list of PDN GW addresses, one PDN GW address is\nselected from this list. If the selected PDN GW cannot be used, e.g. due to\nan error, then another PDN GW is selected from the list. The specific\ninteraction between the MME/SGSN and the Domain Name Service function may\ninclude functionality to allow for the retrieval or provision of additional\ninformation regarding the PDN GW capabilities (e.g. whether the PDN GW\nsupports PMIP-based or GTP-based S5/S8, or both).\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The APN as constructed by the MME/SGSN for PDN GW resolution\n         takes into account the APN-OI Replacement field.

This\noverview applies to eCall Over IMS unless stated otherwise. The specific\nfunctionality is described in the affected procedures and functions of this\nspecification. For discrepancies between this overview clause and the\ndetailed procedure and function descriptions the latter take precedence.\n\nEmergency bearer services are provided to support IMS emergency sessions.\nEmergency bearer services are functionalities provided by the serving\nnetwork when the network is configured to support emergency services.\nEmergency bearer services are provided to normal attached or emergency\nattached UEs and depending on local regulation, to UEs that are in limited\nservice state. Receiving emergency services in limited service state does\nnot require a subscription. Depending on local regulation and an operator's\npolicy, the MME may allow or reject an emergency attach request for UEs in\nlimited service state. Four different behaviours of emergency bearer\nsupport have been identified as follows:\n\n  a. Valid UEs only. No limited service state UEs are supported in the\n    network. Only UEs that have a valid subscription, are authenticated and\n    authorized for PS service in the attached location are allowed. UEs\n    should be attached to the network and then perform a PDN Connection\n    Request when an IMS emergency session is detected by the UE.\n\n  b. Only UEs that are authenticated are allowed. These UEs must have a\n    valid IMSI. These UEs are authenticated and may be in limited service\n    state due to being in a location that they are restricted from service.\n    A UE that can not be authenticated will be rejected.\n\n  c. IMSI required, authentication optional. These UEs must have an IMSI.\n    If authentication fails, the UE is granted access and the\n    unauthenticated IMSI retained in the network for recording purposes.\n    The IMEI is used in the network as the UE identifier. IMEI only UEs\n    will be rejected (e.g., UICCless UEs).\n\n  d. All UEs are allowed. Along with authenticated UEs, this includes UEs\n    with an IMSI that can not be authenticated and UEs with only an IMEI.\n    If an unauthenticated IMSI is provided by the UE, the unauthenticated\n    IMSI is retained in the network for recording purposes. The IMEI is\n    used in the network to identify the UE.\n\nTo provide emergency bearer services, the MME is configured with MME\nEmergency Configuration Data that are applied to all emergency bearer\nservices that are established by an MME on UE request. The MME Emergency\nConfiguration Data contain the Emergency APN which is used to derive a PDN\nGW, or the MME Emergency Configuration Data may also contain the statically\nconfigured PDN GW for the Emergency APN.\n\nUEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10],\ninitiate the Attach procedure with indicating that the attach is to receive\nemergency services. Also UEs that had attached for normal services and do\nnot have emergency bearers established and are camped on a cell in limited\nservice state (e.g. because of restricted Tracking Area or not allowed CSG)\nshall initiate this Attach procedure, indicating that the attach is to\nreceive emergency services. The network supporting emergency services for\nUEs in limited service state provides emergency bearer services to these\nUE, regardless whether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or mobility\nrestrictions or a valid subscription, depending on local regulation. For\nemergency services other than eCall, the UEs in limited service state\ndetermine that the cell supports emergency services over E-UTRAN from a\nbroadcast indicator in AS. Emergency calls for eCall Over IMS are only\nperformed if the UE has a UICC.\n\nA serving network shall provide an Access Stratum broadcast indication to\nUEs as to whether eCall Over IMS is supported.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The Access Stratum broadcast indicator is determined according\n         to operators' preference and minimally indicates that the PLMN, or\n         all of the PLMNs in the case of network sharing, and at least one\n         emergency centre or PSAP to which an eCall Over IMS session can be\n         routed, support eCall Over IMS.\n\nA UE in limited service state determines that the cell supports eCall Over\nIMS using both the broadcast indicator for support of emergency services\nover E-UTRAN and the broadcast indicator for eCall over IMS.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The broadcast indicator for eCall Over IMS does not indicate\n         whether UEs in limited service state are supported, as such the\n         broadcast indicator for support of emergency services over E-UTRAN\n         that indicates limited service state support needs to also be\n         applied.\n\nFor a UE that is Emergency Attached, if it is unauthenticated the EPS\nsecurity context is not set up on UE.\n\nUEs that camp normally on a cell, i.e. without any conditions that result\nin limited service state, initiate the normal initial attach procedure if\nnot already attached. Normal attached UEs initiate the UE Requested PDN\nConnectivity procedure to receive emergency bearer services. The UEs that\ncamp normally on a cell are informed that the PLMN supports emergency\nbearer services over E-UTRAN from the Emergency Service Support indicator\nin the Attach and TAU procedures. UEs that camp normally on a cell may also\nuse the emergency attach procedure under conditions specified in\nTS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46], e.g. when the MM back-off timer is running.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Failure of the normal initial attach may occur e.g. when the\n         network rejects the request with a back-off time.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The establishment of the emergency bearer services may fail when\n         the UE needs to perform a TAU prior to the UE Requested PDN\n         Connectivity procedure, i.e. the UE moved into a non-registered\n         Tracking Area with the MM back-off timer running in the UE.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The Emergency Service Support indicator in the Attach and TAU\n         procedures does not enable support for eCall Over IMS.\n\nFor a UE that is Emergency Attached, normal PLMN selection principles apply\nafter the end of the IMS emergency session.\n\nFor emergency bearer services any EPC functions, procedures and\ncapabilities are provided according to clause\u00a04 except when specified\ndifferently in the following clauses.\n\nFor emergency bearer services, there is a risk of service disruption due to\nfailed inter PLMN mobility attempts.\n\nFor emergency bearer services, handover from non-3GPP access to E-UTRAN\naccess is supported as specified in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2] clause\u00a04.5.7.2.10.\n\nThe UE shall set the RRC establishment cause or RRC resume cause to\nemergency as defined in TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[37] when it requests an RRC connection\nin relation to an emergency session. Specific situations that require\nsetting the RRC establishment cause or RRC resume cause to emergency are\ndescribed in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46].\n\nSupport for emergency bearer services is not available when the UE is using\nNB-IoT, i.e. the MME shall not indicate support for emergency bearer\nservices using the Emergency Service Support indicator in the Attach and\nTAU procedures to a UE that accesses the network using a RAT Type equal to\nNB-IoT, and an NB-IoT cell shall not indicate support for emergency\nservices in any broadcast information in AS.\n\nWhen a PLMN supports IMS and emergency bearer services, all MMEs in that\nPLMN shall have the same capability to support emergency bearer services.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  Idle mode Signalling Reduction (ISR) is not supported by the\n         network for UEs that only have bearers related to emergency bearer\n         service.\n\nFor emergency services other than eCall, a UE that is not in in limited\nservice state, as specified in TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10] determines from a NAS\nindicator whether additional emergency numbers/types received via WLAN from\ntrusted sources may be used for detecting emergency calls.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Architecture Reference Model for Emergency Services", "numbering": "4.3.12.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "4.3.12.2 Architecture Reference Model for Emergency Services\n\nAccording to clause\u00a04.2, the non-roaming architectures (Figure\u00a04.2.1-1 and\nFigure\u00a04.2.1-2) and roaming architecture with the visited operator's\napplication function (Figure\u00a04.2.2-3) apply for emergency services.

Use of a too short\n         timer for the more preferred PLMN search can both prevent the\n         failed network from recovering, and, impose more load on the local\n         competing networks.\n\n  g) At PLMN change, UEs configured to perform Attach with IMSI at PLMN\n    change (see TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[69]) do this rather than a TA update with GUTI\n    (thus avoiding the need to reject the TA update, and to request the\n    IMSI following the subsequent Attach with GUTI).\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  In the case of a network failure, this reduces the message\n         processing load on a local competing network and hence makes that\n         network more likely to survive the failure of the other network.\n\n  h) For mobile originated services, UEs configured for low access priority\n    (see TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[69]) provide a low access priority indication to the\n    MME in NAS signalling that permit the MME to undertake protective\n    measures (e.g. to permit the MME to immediately command the UE to move\n    to a state where it does not need to generate further signalling\n    messages and/or does not reselect PLMNs), as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.7.4.1. Clause\u00a04.3.17.4 describes when low access priority is\n    not applicable.\n\n  i) Using Periodic TAU timer value sent by the HSS and/or UE provided low\n    access priority indication (bullet h above), the MME can allocate a\n    long periodic TAU timer value to the UE. A long periodic TAU timer is\n    likely to slow down the rate at which a UE detects a network failure\n    and thus it slows down the rate of movement of UEs from a failed\n    network to other local competing networks (see clause\u00a04.3.17.3).\n\n  j) Mechanisms for the MME and P-GW to detect congestion associated with a\n    particular APN (see clauses 4.3.7.4.2 and 4.3.7.5).\n\n  k) The addition of 'back off timers' to EMM and ESM signalling messages\n    (e.g. to rejection messages). These include some time randomisation to\n    guard against a repeat of a load peak. The MME should be able to apply\n    this behaviour on a per-APN basis. as described in clause\u00a04.3.7.4.2\n\n  l) Signalling that permits the P-GW to request the MME to generate the\n    above ESM signalling with 'back off timers' (see clause\u00a04.3.7.5).\n\n  m) An MME overload control mechanism to selectively limit the number of\n    Downlink Data Notification requests the S-GW sends to the MME for\n    downlink low priority traffic received for UEs in idle mode (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.7.4.1a).\n\n  n) UE configured for specific handling of the invalid USIM state, the\n    \"forbidden PLMN list\", the \"forbidden PLMNs for attach in S1mode list\"\n    and the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list\" remembers that the USIM\n    is invalid and keeps the PLMN forbidden lists even if the UE is\n    switched off and then switched on.\n\n  o) When the UE has an activated PDN connection without low access\n    priority or the UE is requested to establish such a PDN connection and\n    the UE is configured with a permission for overriding low access\n    priority the UE doesn't provide a low access priority indication to the\n    MME in NAS MM signalling and also not to the RAN in the RRC requests.\n    In the NAS request for activating a PDN connection this UE always\n    indicates what the upper layers requested, i.e. the UE indicates low\n    access priority in that NAS request unless the upper layers request\n    activation of a PDN connection without low access priority.\n\n  p) When the UE has an activated PDN connection that is without low access\n    priority or the UE is requested to activate such a PDN connection and\n    the UE is configured with a permission for overriding Extended Access\n    Barring, then the UE ignores any Extended Access Barring (if it is\n    activated in the network) as defined in TS\u00a022.011\u00a0[67].\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  It is assumed that the mechanisms described in this entire\n         clause are designed by Stage\u00a03 in a manner that allows\n         extensibility and forward compatibility.\n\n  q) The eNodeB may use the low access priority indication provided by the\n    UE to steer UEs configured for low access priority to specific MMEs.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Optimising periodic TAU Signalling", "numbering": "4.3.17.3", "title_level": 3, "desc": "4.3.17.3 Optimising periodic TAU Signalling\n\nTo reduce network load from periodic TAU signalling and to increase the\ntime until the UE detects a potential need for changing the RAT or PLMN\n(e.g. due to network problems) the longer values of the periodic TAU timer\nand Mobile Reachable timer shall be supported.\n\nA long periodic RAU/TAU timer value may be locally configured at MME or may\nbe stored as part of the subscription data in HSS.

The tunnel\nparameters (i.e. destination IP address and UDP port) for SGi PtP tunneling\nbased on UDP/IP are pre-configured on the P-GW. IP address allocation\nprocedures for PDN connections are performed locally (e.g. without\ninvolving the UE) by the P-GW based on APN configuration and according to\nclause\u00a05.3.1. Only single IP address is used (i.e. both IPv4 and IPv6\naddresses are not allocated).\n\nThe P-GW acts as a transparent forwarding node for the payload between the\nUE and the AS.\n\nFor uplink Non-IP data, the P-GW forwards the received data to the AS over\nthe SGi PtP tunnel using UDP/IP encapsulation. When the Reliable Data\nService is enabled, the P-GW processes the Reliable Data Service Header.\nThe Reliable Data Service Configuration is pre-configured on the P-GW. The\nReliable Data Service Configuration is defined in TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74].\n\nFor downlink Non-IP data, the AS sends the data using UDP/IP encapsulation\nwith the IP address of the UE and the 3GPP defined UDP port for \"Non-IP\"\ndata. The P-GW decapsulates the received data (i.e. removes the UDP/IP\nheaders) and forwards the data to S-GW on the GTP-U tunnel identified by\nthe IP address of the UE (i.e. PDN connection) for delivery to the UE. When\nthe Reliable Data Service is enabled, the P-GW adds the Reliable Data\nService Header.\n\nThe P-GW performs the IP related operations (e.g. allocates IP address for\nthe PDN connection), but the IP address or IP prefix is not provided to the\nUE (i.e. SLAAC / Router Advertisements are not performed. DHCP or DHCPv6\nare not used). In case of IPv6 the P-GW assigns an Interface Identifier for\nthe PDN connection. The allocated IP address or IPv6 prefix identifies the\nPDN connection of the UE. The P-GW shall inform the MME of the assigned\nIPv4 address or IPv6 prefix and Interface Identifier for a PDN Connection\nof a given UE. However, the UE is not informed about the assigned IPv6\nprefix and Interface Identifier.\n\n  NOTE:  It is recommended to use IPv6 for CIoT. IPv4 based addressing is\n         deprecated for machine type communication used over 3GPP accesses,\n         see TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27].\n\n\n4.3.17.8.3.3.3  Other SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms\n\nSGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, GTP-C/U, etc, may\nbe used to deliver Non-IP data to AS via SGi. The general handling of such\ndelivery mechanisms is as described below.\n\nA point-to-point tunnel is established by the P-GW towards the AS.\nDepending on the type of protocol employed on the SGi PtP tunnel, the SGi\nPtP tunnel setup may be done at the time of Attach or at the time of first\nMO datagram being sent by the CIoT UE. The P-GW selects the AS based on the\nP-GW configuration (e.g. per APN, or per PtP tunnel type etc.).

The following deployment scenarios are supported for DCN:\n\n  -  DCNs may be deployed to support one RAT only, (e.g. only dedicated\n    MMEs are deployed to support E-UTRAN and dedicated SGSNs are not\n    deployed), to support multiple RATs, or to support all RATs.\n\n  -  Networks deploying DCNs may have a default DCN, which is managing UEs\n    for which a DCN is not available or if sufficient information is not\n    available to assign a UE to a DCN. One or multiple DCNs may be deployed\n    together with a default DCN that all share the same RAN.\n\n  -  The architecture supports scenarios where the DCN is only deployed in\n    a part of the PLMN e.g. only for one RAT or only in a part of the PLMN\n    area. Such heterogeneous or partial deployment of DCNs may, depending\n    on operator deployment and configuration, result in service with\n    different characteristics or functionality, depending on whether the UE\n    is inside or outside the service area or RAT that supports the DCN.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Heterogeneous or partial deployment of DCNs may result in\n         increased occurrence of UEs first being served by a CN node in the\n         default DCN and then being redirected to a CN node in the DCN that\n         serves the UE when the UE moves from areas outside of DCN coverage\n         to an area of DCN coverage. It may also result in an increased re-\n         attach rate in the network. As this has impacts on the required\n         capacity of the default CN nodes deployed at edge of DCN coverage,\n         it is not recommended to deploy DCNs heterogeneously or partially.\n\n  -  Even if the DCN is not deployed to serve a particular RAT or service\n    area of PLMN, the UE in that RAT or service area may still be served by\n    a PDN GW from the DCN.\n\nHigh level overview for supporting DCNs is provided below. Details are\ncaptured in appropriate clauses of this specification, TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] and\nTS\u00a023.236\u00a0[30].\n\n  -  An optional subscription information parameter (\"UE Usage Type\") is\n    used in the selection of a DCN. An operator configures which of his\n    DCN(s) serves which UE Usage Type(s). The HSS provides the \"UE Usage\n    Type\" value in the subscription information of the UE to the MME/SGSN.\n    Both standardized and operator specific values for UE Usage Type are\n    possible.\n\n  -  The serving network selects the DCN based on the operator configured\n    (UE Usage Type to DCN) mapping, other locally configured operator's\n    policies and the UE related context information available at the\n    serving network, e.g. information about roaming. UEs with different UE\n    Usage Type values may be served by the same DCN. Moreover, UEs that\n    share the same UE Usage Type value may be served by different DCNs.\n\n  -  If the configuration shows no DCN for the specific \"UE Usage Type\"\n    value in the subscription information, then the serving MME/SGSN serves\n    the UE by the default DCN or selects a DCN using serving operator\n    specific policies.\n\n  -  Some subscribers may be configured without \"UE Usage Type\" value. In\n    this case, the MME/SGSN may select the DCN that serves the UE using\n    locally configured operator's policies and the UE related context\n    information available at the serving network (other than UE provided\n    DCN-ID). The MME/SGSN performs procedures described in clauses 5.19.1\n    and 5.19.2.\n\n  -  The \"UE Usage Type\" is associated with the UE (describing its usage\n    characteristic), i.e. there is only one UE Usage Type\" per UE\n    subscription.\n\n  -  For each DCN, one or more CN nodes may be configured as part of a\n    pool.\n\n  -  For MME, the MMEGI(s) identifies a DCN within the PLMN. For SGSNs, a\n    group identifier(s) identifies a DCN within the PLMN. That is, the\n    group of SGSNs that belong to a DCN within a PLMN. This identifier may\n    have the same format as NRI (e.g. an NRI value that does not identify a\n    specific SGSN node in the serving area) in which case it is called\n    \"Null-NRI\" or it may have a format independent of NRI, in which case it\n    is called \"SGSN Group ID\". The \"Null-NRI\" or \"SGSN Group ID\" is\n    provided by an SGSN to RAN which triggers the NNSF procedure to select\n    an SGSN from the group of SGSNs corresponding to the Null-NRI/SGSN\n    Group ID (see clause\u00a05.19.1).\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  SGSN Group IDs enable to handle deployment scenarios where in a\n         service area all NRI values are allocated to SGSNs and hence no NRI\n         value remains that can be used as Null-NRI.\n\n  -  The dedicated MME/SGSN that serves the UE selects a dedicated S-GW and\n    P-GW based on UE Usage Type.\n\n  -  At initial access to the network if sufficient information is not\n    available for RAN to select a specific DCN, the RAN may selects a CN\n    node from the default DCN. A redirection to another DCN may then be\n    required.\n\n  -  To redirect a UE from one DCN to a different DCN, the redirection\n    procedure via RAN, described in clause\u00a05.19.1, is used to forward the\n    NAS message of the UE to the target DCN.\n\n  -  All selection functions are aware of DCN(s), including the network\n    node selection function (NNSF) of RAN nodes, for selecting and\n    maintaining the appropriate DCN for the UEs.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UE assisted Dedicated Core Network selection", "numbering": "4.3.25.1a", "title_level": 3, "desc": "4.3.25.1a   UE assisted Dedicated Core Network selection\n\nThis feature is to reduce the need for DECOR reroute by using an indication\n(DCN-ID) sent from the UE and used by RAN to select the correct DCN.

The packet filters signalled in the NAS procedures\nare associated with a unique packet filter identifier on per-PDN connection\nbasis.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The EPS Bearer Identity together with the packet filter\n         identifier is used to reference which packet filter the UE intends\n         to modify or delete, i.e. it is used to implement the unique packet\n         filter identifier.\n\nAn EPS bearer is the level of granularity for bearer level QoS control in\nthe EPC/E-UTRAN.

That bearer is\nreferred to as the default bearer. Any additional EPS bearer that is\nestablished for the same PDN connection is referred to as a dedicated\nbearer.\n\nThe EPS bearer traffic flow template (TFT) is the set of all packet filters\nassociated with that EPS bearer. An UpLink Traffic Flow Template (UL TFT)\nis the set of uplink packet filters in a TFT. A DownLink Traffic Flow\nTemplate (DL TFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT. Every\ndedicated EPS bearer is associated with a TFT. A TFT may be also assigned\nto the default EPS bearer. The UE uses the UL TFT for mapping traffic to an\nEPS bearer in the uplink direction. The PCEF (for GTP-based S5/S8) or the\nBBERF (for PMIP-based S5/S8) uses the DL TFT for mapping traffic to an EPS\nbearer in the downlink direction. The UE may use the UL TFT and DL TFT to\nassociate EPS Bearer Activation or Modification procedures to an\napplication and to traffic flow aggregates of the application. Therefore\nthe PDN GW shall, in the Create Dedicated Bearer Request and the Update\nBearer Request messages, provide all available traffic flow description\ninformation (e.g. source and destination IP address and port numbers and\nthe protocol information).\n\nFor the UE, the evaluation precedence order of the packet filters making up\nthe UL TFTs is signalled from the P-GW to the UE as part of any appropriate\nTFT operations.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The evaluation precedence index of the packet filters associated\n         with the default bearer, in relation to those associated with the\n         dedicated bearers, is up to operator configuration. It is possible\n         to \"force\" certain traffic onto the default bearer by setting the\n         evaluation precedence index of the corresponding filters to a value\n         that is lower than the values used for filters associated with the\n         dedicated bearers.\n\nFurther details about the TFT and the TFT operations are described in\nclause\u00a015.3 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. The details about the TFT packet filter(s)\nare described in clause\u00a015.3.2 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] for PDN connections of IP\ntype and in clause\u00a05.7.6.3 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[83] for PDN connections of\nEthernet type.\n\nA TFT of an uplink unidirectional EPS bearer is only associated with UL\npacket filter(s) that matches the uplink unidirectional traffic flow(s) A\nTFT of a downlink unidirectional EPS bearer is associated with DL packet\nfilter(s) that matches the unidirectional traffic flow(s) and a UL packet\nfilter that effectively disallows any useful packet flows (see\nclause\u00a015.3.3.4 in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] for an example of such packet filter.\n\nThe UE routes uplink packets to the different EPS bearers based on uplink\npacket filters in the TFTs assigned to these EPS bearers. The UE evaluates\nfor a match, first the uplink packet filter amongst all TFTs that has the\nlowest evaluation precedence index and, if no match is found, proceeds with\nthe evaluation of uplink packet filters in increasing order of their\nevaluation precedence index. This procedure shall be executed until a match\nis found or all uplink packet filters have been evaluated. If a match is\nfound, the uplink data packet is transmitted on the EPS bearer that is\nassociated with the TFT of the matching uplink packet filter. If no match\nis found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the EPS bearer that has\nnot been assigned any uplink packet filter. If all EPS bearers (including\nthe default EPS bearer for that PDN) have been assigned one or more uplink\npacket filters, the UE shall discard the uplink data packet.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The above algorithm implies that there is at most one EPS bearer\n         without any uplink packet filter. Therefore, some UEs may expect\n         that during the lifetime of a PDN connection (where only network\n         has provided TFT packet filters) at most one EPS bearer exists\n         without any uplink packet filter.\n\nTo ensure that at most one EPS bearer exists without any uplink packet\nfilter, the PCEF (for GTP-based S5/S8) or the BBERF (for PMIP-based S5/S8)\nmaintains a valid state for the TFT settings of the PDN connection as\ndefined in clause\u00a015.3.0 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] and if necessary, adds a packet\nfilter which effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink\ndirection (see clause\u00a015.3.3.4 in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] for an example of such a\npacket filter) to the TFT of a dedicated bearer.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The default bearer is the only bearer that may be without any\n         uplink packet filter and thus, a packet filter which effectively\n         disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction will not be\n         added by the PCEF/BBERF.\n\nThe initial bearer level QoS parameter values of the default bearer are\nassigned by the network, based on subscription data (in E-UTRAN the MME\nsets those initial values based on subscription data retrieved from HSS).\n\nIn a non-roaming scenario, the PCEF may change the QoS parameter value\nreceived from the MME based on interaction with the PCRF or based on local\nconfiguration. When the PCEF changes those values, the MME shall use the\nbearer level QoS parameter values received on the S11 reference point\nduring establishment or modification of the default bearer.\n\nIn a roaming scenario, based on local configuration, the MME may downgrade\nthe ARP or APN-AMBR and/or remap QCI parameter values received from HSS to\nthe value locally configured in MME (e.g. when the values received from HSS\ndo not comply with services provided by the visited PLMN). The PCEF may\nchange the QoS parameter values received from the MME based on interaction\nwith the PCRF or based on local configuration. Alternatively, the PCEF may\nreject the bearer establishment.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  For certain APNs (e.g. the IMS APN defined by the GSMA) the QCI\n         value is strictly defined and therefore remapping of QCI is not\n         permitted.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  In roaming scenarios, the ARP/APN-AMBR/QCI values provided by\n         the MME for a default bearer may deviate from the subscribed values\n         depending on the roaming agreement. If the PCC/PCEF rejects the\n         establishment of the default bearer, this implies that Attach via E-\n         UTRAN will fail. Similarly, if the PCEF (based on interaction with\n         the PCRF or based on local configuration) upgrades the ARP/APN-\n         AMBR/QCI parameter values received from the MME, the default bearer\n         establishment and attach may be rejected by the MME.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  Subscription data related to bearer level QoS parameter values\n         retrieved from the HSS are not applicable for dedicated bearers.\n\nFor WB-E-UTRA, the decision to establish or modify a dedicated bearer can\nonly be taken by the EPC, and the bearer level QoS parameter values are\nalways assigned by the EPC.\n\nDedicated bearers are not supported over NB-IoT. The PDN GW uses the RAT\nType to ensure that no dedicated bearers are active when the UE is\naccessing over NB-IoT. In case of inter-RAT mobility from WB-EUTRA to NB-\nIoT, the UE and MME indicate local deactivation of non-default EPS bearers\nat TAU as specified in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46].\n\nThe MME shall not modify the bearer level QoS parameter values received on\nthe S11 reference point during establishment or modification of a default\nor dedicated bearer (except when the conditions described in NOTE\u00a08 apply).\nConsequently, \"QoS negotiation\" between the E-UTRAN and the EPC during\ndefault or dedicated bearer establishment / modification is not supported.\nBased on local configuration, the MME may reject the establishment or\nmodification of a default or dedicated bearer  if the bearer level QoS\nparameter values sent by the PCEF over a GTP based S8 roaming interface do\nnot comply with a roaming agreement.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  The MME, based on local policies, can downgrade the ARP pre-\n         emption capability, APN-AMBR or MBR (for GBR bearers) parameters\n         received over S8 and allow the bearer establishment or modification\n         of a default or dedicated bearer. The HPLMN is expected to set EPS\n         QoS parameters compliant with roaming agreements, therefore the\n         HPLMN is not informed about any downgrade of EPS bearer QoS\n         parameters. The consequences of such a downgrade are that APN-AMBR\n         and MBR enforcement at the HPLMN and at the UE will not be aligned.\n\nAt inter-RAT mobility, based on local configuration, the MME may perform a\nmapping of QCI values for which there is no mapping defined in Table E.3 or\nwhich are not supported in the target RAT.\n\n  NOTE\u00a010: The PCRF ensures that the EPS bearer QCI values are aligned with\n         the QCI values mapped by the MME for the current RAT as described\n         in clause\u00a0A.4.1.2 of TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\nThe distinction between default and dedicated bearers should be transparent\nto the access network (e.g. E-UTRAN).\n\nAn EPS bearer is referred to as a GBR bearer if dedicated network resources\nrelated to a Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) value that is associated with the\nEPS bearer are permanently allocated (e.g. by an admission control function\nin the eNodeB) at bearer establishment/modification. Otherwise, an EPS\nbearer is referred to as a Non-GBR bearer.\n\n  NOTE\u00a011: Admission control can be performed at establishment /\n         modification of a Non-GBR bearer even though a Non-GBR bearer is\n         not associated with a GBR value.\n\nA dedicated bearer can either be a GBR or a Non-GBR bearer. A default\nbearer shall be a Non-GBR bearer.\n\n  NOTE\u00a012: A default bearer provides the UE with connectivity throughout\n         the lifetime of the PDN connection. That motivates the restriction\n         of a default bearer to bearer type Non-GBR.\n\n\n4.7.2.2  The EPS bearer with GTP-based S5/S8\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n         Figure 4.7.2.2-1: Two Unicast EPS bearers (GTP-based S5/S8)\n\nAn EPS bearer is realized by the following elements:\n\n  -  In the UE, the UL TFT maps a traffic flow aggregate to an EPS bearer\n    in the uplink direction;\n\n  -  In the PDN\u00a0GW, the DL TFT maps a traffic flow aggregate to an EPS\n    bearer in the downlink direction;\n\n  -  A radio bearer (defined in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]) transports the packets of an\n    EPS bearer between a UE and an eNodeB. If a radio bearer exists, there\n    is a one-to-one mapping between an EPS bearer and this radio bearer;\n\n  -  An S1 bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between an eNodeB\n    and a Serving GW;\n\n  -  An E-RAB (E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer) refers to the concatenation of\n    an S1 bearer and the corresponding radio bearer, as defined in\n    TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  -  An S5/S8 bearer transports the packets of an EPS bearer between a\n    Serving GW and a PDN GW;\n\n  -  A UE stores a mapping between an uplink packet filter and a radio\n    bearer to create the mapping between a traffic flow aggregate and a\n    radio bearer in the uplink;\n\n  -  A PDN GW stores a mapping between a downlink packet filter and an\n    S5/S8 bearer to create the mapping between a traffic flow aggregate and\n    an S5/S8 bearer in the downlink;\n\n  -  An eNodeB stores a one-to-one mapping between a radio bearer and an S1\n    Bearer to create the mapping between a radio bearer and an S1 bearer in\n    both the uplink and downlink;\n\n  -  A Serving GW stores a one-to-one mapping between an S1 Bearer and an\n    S5/S8 bearer to create the mapping between an S1 bearer and an S5/S8\n    bearer in both the uplink and downlink.\n\nThe PDN GW routes downlink packets to the different EPS bearers based on\nthe downlink packet filters in the TFTs assigned to the EPS bearers in the\nPDN connection. Upon reception of a downlink data packet, the PDN GW\nevaluates for a match, first the downlink packet filter that has the lowest\nevaluation precedence index and, if no match is found, proceeds with the\nevaluation of downlink packet filters in increasing order of their\nevaluation precedence index. This procedure shall be executed until a match\nis found, in which case the downlink data packet is tunnelled to the\nServing GW on the EPS bearer that is associated with the TFT of the\nmatching downlink packet filter. If no match is found, the downlink data\npacket shall be sent via the EPS bearer that does not have any TFT\nassigned. If all EPS bearers (including the default EPS bearer for that\nPDN) have been assigned a TFT, the PDN GW shall discard the downlink data\npacket.\n\n\n4.7.2.3  The EPS bearer with PMIP-based S5/S8\n\nSee clause\u00a04.10.3 in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Bearer level QoS parameters", "numbering": "4.7.3", "title_level": 2, "desc": "4.7.3  Bearer level QoS parameters\n\nThe EPS bearer QoS profile includes the parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR,\ndescribed in this clause. This clause also describes QoS parameters which\nare applied to an aggregated set of EPS Bearers: APN-AMBR and UE-AMBR.\n\nEach EPS bearer (GBR and Non-GBR) is associated with the following bearer\nlevel QoS parameters:\n\n  -  QoS Class Identifier (QCI);\n\n  -  Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).\n\nA QCI is a scalar that is used as a reference to access node-specific\nparameters that control bearer level packet forwarding treatment (e.g.\nscheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds, link\nlayer protocol configuration, etc.), and that have been pre-configured by\nthe operator owning the access node (e.g. eNodeB). A one-to-one mapping of\nstandardized QCI values to standardized characteristics is captured in\nTS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  On the radio interface and on S1, each PDU (e.g. RLC PDU or GTP-\n         U PDU) is indirectly associated with one QCI via the bearer\n         identifier carried in the PDU header. The same applies to the S5\n         and S8 interfaces if they are based on GTP.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  When required by operator policy, the eNodeB can be configured\n         to also use the ARP priority level in addition to the QCI to\n         control bearer level packet forwarding treatment in the eNodeB for\n         SDFs having high priority ARPs.\n\nThe ARP shall contain information about the priority level (scalar), the\npre-emption capability (flag) and the pre-emption vulnerability (flag). The\nprimary purpose of ARP is to decide whether a bearer establishment /\nmodification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected due to\nresource limitations (typically available radio capacity for GBR bearers).\nThe priority level information of the ARP is used for this decision to\nensure that the request of the bearer with the higher priority level is\npreferred. In addition, the ARP can be used (e.g. by the eNodeB) to decide\nwhich bearer(s) to drop during exceptional resource limitations (e.g. at\nhandover). The pre-emption capability information of the ARP defines\nwhether a bearer with a lower ARP priority level should be dropped to free\nup the required resources. The pre-emption vulnerability information of the\nARP defines whether a bearer is applicable for such dropping by a pre-\nemption capable bearer with a higher ARP priority level.\n\nOnce a bearer has been successfully established, the packet handling (e.g.\nscheduling and rate control) within the eNodeB, PDN GW, and Serving GW\nshould be solely determined by the following EPS bearer QoS parameters:\nQCI, GBR and MBR, and by the AMBR parameters. However, when required by\noperator policy, the eNodeB can be configured to also use a bearer's ARP\npriority level in addition to the QCI to determine the relative priority of\nthe SDFs for packet handling (e.g. scheduling and rate control) in the\neNodeB as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] clause\u00a06.1.7.2. This configuration\napplies only for bearers with high priority ARPs as defined in\nTS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] clause\u00a06.1.7.3.\n\nThe ARP priority level may be used in addition to the QCI to determine the\ntransport level packet marking, e.g. to set the DiffServ Code Point. The\nARP is not included within the EPS QoS Profile sent to the UE.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The ARP should be understood as \"Priority of Allocation and\n         Retention\"; not as \"Allocation, Retention, and Priority\".\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  Video telephony is one use case where it may be beneficial to\n         use EPS bearers with different ARP values for the same UE. In this\n         use case an operator could map voice to one bearer with a higher\n         ARP, and video to another bearer with a lower ARP. In a congestion\n         situation (e.g. cell edge) the eNodeB can then drop the \"video\n         bearer\" without affecting the \"voice bearer\". This would improve\n         service continuity.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The ARP may also be used to free up capacity in exceptional\n         situations, e.g. a disaster situation. In such a case the eNodeB\n         may drop bearers with a lower ARP priority level to free up\n         capacity if the pre-emption vulnerability information allows this.\n\nEach GBR bearer is additionally associated with the following bearer level\nQoS parameters:\n\n  -  Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR);\n\n  -  Maximum Bit Rate (MBR).\n\nThe GBR denotes the bit rate that can be expected to be provided by a GBR\nbearer. The MBR limits the bit rate that can be expected to be provided by\na GBR bearer (e.g. excess traffic may get discarded by a rate shaping\nfunction). See clause\u00a04.7.4 for further details on GBR and MBR.\n\nGBR bearers are not supported by NB-IoT. The PDN GW uses the RAT Type to\nensure that GBR bearers are not active when the UE is using NB-IoT.\n\nEach APN access, by a UE, is associated with the following QoS parameter:\n\n  -  per APN Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (APN-AMBR).\n\nThe subscribed APN-AMBR is a subscription parameter stored per APN in the\nHSS, which applies as APN-AMBR unless the APN-AMBR is modified by the MME\n(e.g in roaming scenarios and/or for usage of NB-IoT) or the PDN GW, based\non local policy (e.g. for RAT Type = NB-IoT) or PCRF interactions. The APN-\nAMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided\nacross all Non-GBR bearers and across all PDN connections of the same APN\n(e.g. excess traffic may get discarded by a rate shaping function). Each of\nthose Non-GBR bearers could potentially utilize the entire APN-AMBR, e.g.\nwhen the other Non-GBR bearers do not carry any traffic. GBR bearers are\noutside the scope of APN-AMBR. The P-GW enforces the APN-AMBR in downlink.\nEnforcement of APN-AMBR in uplink is done in the UE and additionally in the\nP-GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  All simultaneous active PDN connections of a UE that are\n         associated with the same APN shall be provided by the same PDN GW\n         (see clauses\u00a04.3.8.1 and 5.10.1).\n\nAPN-AMBR applies to all PDN connections of an APN. For the case of multiple\nPDN connections of an APN, if a change of APN-AMBR occurs due to local\npolicy or the PDN GW is provided the updated APN-AMBR for each PDN\nconnection from the MME or PCRF, the PDN GW initiates explicit signaling\nfor each PDN connection to update the APN-AMBR value.\n\nEach UE in state EMM-REGISTERED is associated with the following bearer\naggregate level QoS parameter:\n\n  -  per UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (UE-AMBR).\n\nThe UE-AMBR is limited by a subscription parameter stored in the HSS. The\nMME shall set the UE-AMBR to the sum of the APN-AMBR of all active APNs up\nto the value of the subscribed UE-AMBR. The UE-AMBR limits the aggregate\nbit rate that can be expected to be provided across all Non-GBR bearers of\na UE (e.g. excess traffic may get discarded by a rate shaping function).\nEach of those Non-GBR bearers could potentially utilize the entire UE-AMBR,\ne.g. when the other Non-GBR bearers do not carry any traffic. GBR bearers\nare outside the scope of UE AMBR. The E-UTRAN enforces the UE-AMBR in\nuplink and downlink except for PDN connections using the Control Plane CIoT\nEPS Optimisation.\n\nThe GBR and MBR denote bit rates of traffic per bearer while UE-AMBR/APN-\nAMBR denote bit rates of traffic per group of bearers. Each of those QoS\nparameters has an uplink and a downlink component. On S1_MME the values of\nthe GBR, MBR, and AMBR refer to the bit stream excluding the GTP-U/IP\nheader overhead of the tunnel on S1_U.\n\nThe HSS defines, for each PDN subscription context, the 'EPS subscribed QoS\nprofile' which contains the bearer level QoS parameter values for the\ndefault bearer (QCI and ARP) and the subscribed APN-AMBR value. The\nsubscribed ARP shall be used to set the priority level of the EPS bearer\nparameter ARP for the default bearer while the pre-emption capability and\nthe pre-emption vulnerability information for the default bearer are set\nbased on MME operator policy. In addition, the subscribed ARP shall be\napplied by the P-GW for setting the ARP priority level of all dedicated EPS\nbearers of the same PDN connection unless a different ARP priority level\nsetting is required (due to P-GW configuration or interaction with the\nPCRF).\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  The ARP parameter of the EPS bearer can be modified by the P-GW\n         (e.g. based on interaction with the PCRF due to e.g. MPS user\n         initiated session) to assign the appropriate pre-emption capability\n         and the pre-emption vulnerability setting.\n\nThe ARP pre-emption vulnerability of the default bearer should be set\nappropriately to minimize the risk of unnecessary release of the default\nbearer.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Support for Application / Service Layer Rate Adaptation", "numbering": "4.7.4", "title_level": 2, "desc": "4.7.4  Support for Application / Service Layer Rate Adaptation\n\nThe E-UTRAN/UTRAN and the UE support the RFC\u00a03168\u00a0[55] Explicit Congestion\nNotification (ECN), as described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5], TS\u00a025.401\u00a0[16] and\nTS\u00a026.114\u00a0[56].

The PDN GW\nor SCEF can send an APN Uplink Rate Control command to the UE using the PCO\ninformation element.\n\nThe APN Uplink Rate Control applies to data PDUs sent on that APN by either\nData Radio Bearers (S1-U) or Signalling Radio Bearers (NAS Data PDUs).\n\nThe rate control information is separate for uplink and downlink and in the\nform of:\n\n  -  a positive integer 'number of packets per time unit', and\n\n  -  an indication as to whether or not exception reports can still be sent\n    if this rate control limit has been met, and\n\n  -  if the UE indicated support for it, an integer 'number of additional\n    allowed exception report packets per time unit' once the rate control\n    limit has been reached.\n\nUEs supporting APN Rate Control shall support the 'number of additional\nallowed exception report packets per time unit' and shall provide an\nindication to the CN at PDN connection establishment.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Pre-Rel-14 UEs do not support the 'number of additional allowed\n         exception report packets per time unit' and do not send an\n         indication to the CN at PDN connection establishment.\n\nThe UE shall comply with this uplink rate control instruction. If the UE\nexceeds the uplink 'number of packets per time unit', the UE may still send\nuplink exception reports if allowed and the 'number of additional allowed\nexception reports per time unit' has not been exceeded. The UE shall\nconsider this rate control instruction as valid until it receives a new one\nfrom either PDN GW or from SCEF.\n\nWhen the last PDN connection using a given APN is released, the APN Rate\nControl Status (including the number of packets still allowed in the given\ntime unit, the number of additional exception reports still allowed in the\ngiven time unit and the termination time of the current APN Rate Control\nvalidity period) may be stored in the MME so that it can be retrieved for a\nsubsequent re-establishment of a new first PDN connection for that given\nAPN.\n\nAt subsequent establishment of a new first PDN connection for that given\nAPN, the PDN GW/SCEF may receive the previously stored APN Rate Control\nStatus and, if the first APN Rate Control validity period has not expired,\nit applies the received APN Rate Control Status and provides the related\nparameters to the UE in the PCO (instead of the configured APN Rate Control\nparameters). If the initially applied parameters differ from the configured\nAPN Rate Control parameters, the PDN GW/SCEF uses the configured APN Rate\nControl parameters once the first APN Rate Control validity period expires,\nand sends an update to the UE with the configured APN Rate Control\nparameters.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The storage of the APN Rate Control Status information for very\n         long time intervals can be implementation specific.\n\nThe PDN GW or SCEF realises the APN rate control based on a 'maximum\nallowed rate' per direction. If PDN GW or SCEF provided the 'number of\nadditional allowed exception report packets per time unit' to the UE, then\nthe 'maximum allowed rate' is equal to the 'number of packets per time\nunit' plus the 'number of additional allowed exception report packets per\ntime unit'.

To overcome this\n         problem, the PDN GW or SCEF can still apply a configured 'number of\n         additional allowed exception report packets per time unit' even\n         though not sent to pre-Rel-14 UEs.\n\nThe PDN GW or SCEF may enforce the uplink rate by discarding or delaying\npackets that exceed the 'maximum allowed rate'.

One\noptimisation is based on User Plane transport of user data and is referred\nto as User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation. Another optimisation, known as\nControl Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, transports user data or SMS messages\nvia MME by encapsulating them in NAS, reducing the total number of control\nplane messages when handling a short data transaction. For EPC Mobile\nOriginated Location Request (EPC-MO-LR) and EPC Mobile Terminated Location\nRequest (EPC-MT-LR) when the UE and network support Control Plane CIoT EPS\nOptimisation, Control Plane Service Request is used. These optimisations\ncan be used separately e.g. if the UE or the network supports one of them,\nor in parallel if the UE and the network supports both. If both the Control\nPlane and User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisations are supported for a UE, the PDN\nconnections that only use the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, i.e. the\nMME has included Control Plane Only Indicator in the ESM request, will only\nbe handled via the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation. All other PDN\nconnections are handled using Control Plane or User Plane CIoT EPS\nOptimisations. In addition, the Control Plane CIoT Optimisation can be used\nto support PDN connections to an SCEF, while regular S1-U data transfer is\nused independently to support PDN connections to P-GW. The MME shall\nconsistently include Control Plane Only Indicator either in all SGi PDN\nconnections of a UE or in none of them. All the SGi PDN connections of a UE\nshall either use S11-U or S1-U at any point in time.\n\nThe CIoT data could include e.g. status information, measurement data from\nMachine-to-Machine applications.\n\nSeveral types of MME are envisaged, e.g.\n\n  -  an MME that supports either User Plane or Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation;\n\n  -  an MME that supports both User Plane and Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisations;\n\n  -  an MME that does not support any CIoT EPS Optimisations.\n\nThe E-UTRAN shall support the routeing of UEs to an MME that can process\nthe request from the UE.\n\nThe CIoT EPS Optimisations are negotiated as described in clause\u00a04.3.5.10\n\"Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour\".\n\nCIoT EPS Optimisations may be supported also by UEs that are not limited to\nlow complexity and low throughput applications for Machine Type\nCommunications.\n\nIf Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies, separation of S11-U from S1-\nU may be required, and if required, the MME and the Serving GW shall handle\nthe IP address and TEID for the S1-U and the address and TEID for the S11-U\nseparately.\n\n  NOTE:  Homogeneous support of separation of S11-U from S1-U in the MMEs\n         and Serving GWs is assumed.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation", "numbering": "4.11", "title_level": 1, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Supporting up to  EPS bearers per UE", "numbering": "4.12", "title_level": 1, "desc": "4.11 User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\n\nThe User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation functionality enables support for\ntransfer of user plane data without the need for using the Service Request\nprocedure to establish Access Stratum (AS) context in the serving eNodeB\nand UE.\n\nIf the following preconditions are met:\n\n  -  UE and MME support User Plane CIOT EPS Optimisation as defined in\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.10,\n\n  -  MME indicates \"UE User Plane CIoT Support Indicator\" IE to \"supported\"\n    as defined in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36],\n\n  -  and the UE performs an initial connection establishment that\n    establishes the AS bearers and the AS security context in the network\n    and UE,\n\nthen the RRC connection can be suspended by means of a Connection Suspend\nProcedure (see clause\u00a05.3.4A).\n\nBased on trigger from the NAS layer when UE is in ECM-IDLE including if it\nattempts to send data using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation as defined\nin clause\u00a05.3.4B, the UE shall attempt the Connection Resume procedure, see\nclause\u00a05.3.5A and TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46].

To enable support of establishing 15 EPS bearers, it requires the\nEPC connected to the E-UTRAN access to support 15 EPS bearers for such UEs.\n\nIf the UE supports 15 EPS bearers, then the UE shall indicate this to the\nMME in NAS signalling as defined in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46].\n\nThe network shall support E-UTRAN idle mode mobility and handover\nprocedures in such PLMNs, where only part of the network nodes have been\nupgraded to support 15 EPS bearers. In case of mobility procedures\ninvolving target nodes not supporting 15 EPS bearers, additional bearers\nnot supported by the non-upgraded nodes should be thus released.\n\nThe network shall homogeneously support 15 EPS bearers per UE, at least per\nMME pool area/SGW serving area, in order to avoid EPS bearer deactivations\nand attempts from services to re-activate the deactivated EPS bearers\ncaused by UE mobility within that area, by defining the tracking areas\naccordingly (see clause\u00a04.3.5.3).\n\nThe MME shall provide the UE with a TAI List such that it triggers the UE\nto perform the TAU procedure, as defined in clause\u00a05.3.3.0, when the UE\nenters and exits the area with support for 15 EPS bearers per UE. The TAU\nprocedure execution enables the nodes in the supporting area to identify a\nsupporting UE when it enters the area. When exiting the area, also enables\nthe nodes to remove bearer resources for the UE towards nodes without\nsupport for 15 EPS bearers per UE.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  In order for the above TAI List handling to be fully successful,\n         the network requires the PGWs the UE is connected to from these MME\n         pool area/SGW serving area to be upgaded to support 15 EPS bearers.\n\nFor a UE supporting 15 EPS bearers, mobility to UTRAN or GERAN may also\nlead to selective release of EPS bearers, due to the lack of support of 15\nPDP contexts in the GPRS core network and Radio Access networks.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  EPS bearers need to be released either because the UE has more\n         than 8 active EPS bearers, or because they are identified by EPS\n         Bearer Identities not supported.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact from release of bearers not supported by\nthe target nodes during mobility, the MME should be able to allocate the\nEPS bearer IDs in such way that the bearers with higher operator preference\nwill be preserved in case of mobility involving legacy target nodes. This\nprioritised bearer allocation should be based on, at least, the Allocation\nRetention Priority of the EPS bearers and may take other bearer parameters\n(e.g. QCI, APN) into consideration.\n\nAll PDN GWs in a PLMN shall support 15 EPS bearers. MME may be configured\nto take into account additional PDN GW information such as whether the\nHPLMN supports 15 EPS bearers when selecting PDN GW (e.g. in case of\nroaming users Home Routed PDN GW selection) for UEs supporting 15 EPS\nbearers.\n\nFor inter-PLMN handover, support of 15 EPS bearers is based on MME\nconfiguration according to operator policy (e.g. bilateral agreements\nbetween operators).\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Functional description and information flows", "numbering": "5", "title_level": 0, "desc": "5  Functional description and information flows\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Control and user planes", "numbering": "5.1", "title_level": 1, "desc": "5.1  Control and user planes\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "General", "numbering": "5.1.0", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.1.0  General\n\n  NOTE:\n\n       -  Refer to TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2] for the corresponding protocol stack for\n         PMIP based S5/S8.\n\n       -  Refer to TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] for the corresponding protocol stack for\n         Policy Control and Charging (PCC) function related reference\n         points.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Control Plane", "numbering": "5.1.1", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.1.1  Control Plane\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "General", "numbering": "5.1.1.1", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.1.1.1  General\n\nThe control plane consists of protocols for control and support of the user\nplane functions:\n\n  -  controlling the E-UTRA network access connections, such as attaching\n    to and detaching from E-UTRAN;\n\n  -  controlling the attributes of an established network access\n    connection, such as activation of an IP address;\n\n  -  controlling the routing path of an established network connection in\n    order to support user mobility; and\n\n  -  controlling the assignment of network resources to meet changing user\n    demands.\n\nThe following control planes are used in E-UTRAN mode.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "eNodeB - MME", "numbering": "5.1.1.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.1.1.2  eNodeB - MME\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n  Legend:\n  -  S1 Application Protocol (S1-AP): Application Layer Protocol between\n         the eNodeB and the MME.\n  -  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP): This protocol guarantees\n         delivery of signalling messages between MME and eNodeB (S1).

IP address allocation for\nPDN connections, which are activated by the UE requested PDN connectivity\nprocedure, is handled with the same set of mechanisms as those used within\nthe Attach procedure.\n\nPDN types IPv4, IPv6 and IPv4v6 are supported. An EPS Bearer of PDN type\nIPv4v6 may be associated with one IPv6 prefix only or with both one IPv4\naddress and one IPv6 prefix. PDN type IPv4 is associated with an IPv4\naddress.

In addition, PDN type IPv4 and IPv6 are utilised for\ninterworking with nodes of earlier releases.\n\nThe way that the UE sets the requested PDN type may be pre-configured in\nthe device per APN. Unless otherwise configured (including when the UE does\nnot send any APN), the UE sets the PDN type during the Attach or PDN\nConnectivity procedures based on its IP stack configuration as follows:\n\n  -  A UE which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable shall request for PDN type IPv4v6.\n\n  -  A UE which is only IPv4 capable shall request for PDN type IPv4.\n\n  -  A UE which is only IPv6 capable shall request for PDN type IPv6.\n\n  -  When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in\n    the case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE\n    is not known in the MT), the UE shall request for PDN type IPv4v6.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  At intersystem changes between GERAN/UTRAN and E-UTRAN there is\n         a 1-to-1 mapping between PDP type IPv4v6 and PDN type IPv4v6\n         without re-negotiation of the PDP/PDN type used for a PDN\n         connection.\n\nThe HSS stores one or more PDN types per APN in the subscription data.\nDuring the Attach or UE requested PDN connectivity procedure the MME\ncompares the requested PDN type to the PDN type in the subscription records\nfor the given APN and sets the PDN type as follows:\n\n  -  If the requested PDN type is allowed by subscription, the MME sets the\n    PDN type as requested.\n\n  -  If the requested PDN type is IPv4v6 and subscription data only allows\n    PDN type IPv4 or only allows PDN type IPv6, the MME sets the PDN type\n    according to the subscribed value. A reason cause shall be returned to\n    the UE indicating that only the assigned PDN type is allowed. In this\n    case the UE shall not request another PDN connection to the same APN\n    for the other IP version during the existence of the PDN connection.\n\n  -  If the requested PDN type is IPv4 or IPv6, and either the requested\n    PDN type or PDN type IPv4v6 are subscribed, the MME sets the PDN type\n    as requested. Otherwis the PDN connection request is rejected.\n\n  -  If the requested PDN type is IPv4v6, and both IPv4 and IPv6 PDN types\n    are allowed by subscription but not IPv4v6, the MME shall set the PDN\n    type to IPv4 or IPv6 where the selection between IPv4 and IPv6 is\n    implementation specific. The UE should then initiate the UE requested\n    PDN connectivity procedure to this APN in order to activate a second\n    PDN connection with the other single address PDN type which was not\n    allocated by the network.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the MT and TE are separated, the UE might not be able to use\n         reason cause \"single address bearers only\" as a trigger for\n         activating a second single-stack EPS bearer.\n\nThe PDN GW may restrict the usage of a PDN type IPv4v6 as follows.\n\n  -  If the PDN GW receives a request for PDN type IPv4v6, but the PDN GW\n    operator preferences dictate the use of IPv4 addressing only or IPv6\n    prefix only for this APN, the PDN type shall be changed to a single\n    address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6) and a reason cause shall be returned to\n    the UE indicating that only the assigned PDN type is allowed. In this\n    case the UE shall not request another PDN connection to the same APN\n    for the other IP version during the existence of the PDN connection.\n\n  -  If the PDN GW receives a request for PDN type IPv4v6, but the MME does\n    not set the Dual Address Bearer Flag due to the MME operator using\n    single addressing per bearer to support interworking with nodes of\n    earlier releases the PDN type shall be changed to a single IP version\n    only and a reason cause shall be returned to the UE indicating that\n    only single IP version per PDN connection is allowed. In this case the\n    UE should request another PDN connection for the other IP version using\n    the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN with a\n    single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6) other than the one already\n    activated.\n\nDuring inter-RAT mobility between E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, an EPS bearer\nwith PDN type IPv4v6 shall be mapped one-to-one to PDP type IPv4v6.\n\nDuring inter-RAT mobility between E-UTRAN and UTRAN/GERAN, an EPS bearer\nwith PDN type IPv4 shall be mapped one-to-one to a PDP context of PDP type\nIPv4. An EPS bearer with PDN type IPv6 shall be mapped one-to-one to a PDP\ncontext of PDP type IPv6.\n\nIt is the HPLMN operator that shall define in the subscription whether a\ndynamic HPLMN or VPLMN address may be used.\n\nThe EPS UE may indicate to the network within the Protocol Configuration\nOptions element that the UE wants to obtain the IPv4 address with DHCPv4,\nwhich is a deferred IPv4 address allocation option, or during the default\nbearer activation procedure. This implies the following behaviour both for\nstatic and dynamic address allocation:\n\n  -  the UE may indicate that it prefers to obtain an IPv4 address as part\n    of the default bearer activation procedure. In such a case, the UE\n    relies on the EPS network to provide IPv4 address to the UE as part of\n    the default bearer activation procedure.\n\n  -  the UE may indicate that it prefers to obtain the IPv4 address after\n    the default bearer setup by DHCPv4. That is, when the EPS network\n    supports DHCPv4 and allows that, it does not provide the IPv4 address\n    for the UE as part of the default bearer activation procedures. The\n    network may respond to the UE by setting the PDN Address to 0.0.0.0.\n    After the default bearer establishment procedure is completed, the UE\n    uses the connectivity with the EPS and initiates the IPv4 address\n    allocation on its own using DHCPv4. However, if the EPS network\n    provides IPv4 address to the UE as part of the default bearer\n    activation procedure, the UE should accept the IPv4 address indicated\n    in the default bearer activation procedure.\n\n  -  if the UE sends no Address Allocation Preference, the PDN GW\n    determines whether DHCPv4 is used between the UE and the PDN GW (for\n    the deferred IPv4 address allocation) or not, based on per APN\n    configuration\n\nBoth EPS network elements and UE shall support the following mechanisms:\n\n  a. IPv4 address allocation via default bearer activation, if IPv4 is\n    supported.\n\n  b. /64 IPv6 prefix allocation via IPv6 Stateless Address\n    autoconfiguration according to RFC\u00a04862\u00a0[18], if IPv6 is supported;\n\nFurthermore, the Protocol Configuration Options may be used during bearer\nactivation to configure parameters which are needed for IP address\nallocation.\n\nBoth EPS network elements and UE may support the following mechanisms:\n\n  a. IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration after the\n    attach procedure via DHCPv4 according to RFC\u00a02131\u00a0[19] and\n    RFC\u00a04039\u00a0[25];\n\n  b. IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 according to\n    RFC\u00a03736\u00a0[20].\n\n  c. Allocation of IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6 according to RFC\u00a03633\u00a0[21].\n\nEPS network elements may support the following mechanism:\n\n  a. Allocation of a static IPv4 address and/or a static IPv6 prefix based\n    on subscription data in the HSS.\n\nIf the static IP address/prefix is not stored in the HSS subscription\nrecord, it may be configured on a per-user per-APN basis in the\nDHCP/Radius/Diameter server and the PDN GW retrieves the IP address/prefix\nfor the UE from the DHCP/Radius/Diameter server. In this case, static IP\naddress/prefix is allocated by the same procedures as the dynamic IP\naddress/prefix allocation (i.e. in such cases it is transparent to the PDN\nGW if the IP address is static or dynamic).\n\nIf the static IP address/prefix is stored in the HSS subscription record,\nduring the default bearer establishment the PDN GW receives this static IP\naddress/prefix from Serving GW. In this case the PDN GW shall deliver the\nreceived address/prefix to the UE. The static IP address/prefix is\ndelivered to the UE in the same way as a dynamic IP address/prefix. Thus it\nis transparent to the UE whether the PLMN or the external PDN allocates the\nIP address and whether the IP address is static or dynamic.\n\nThe following clauses describe how the above listed IP address allocation\nmechanisms work when GTP based S5/S8 is used. The way of working of the IP\naddress allocation mechanisms for PMIP based S5/S8 can be found in\nTS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].The procedures can be used both for PLMN (VPLMN/HPLMN) or\nexternal PDN based IP address allocation.\n\nIn order to support DHCP based IP address configuration, the PDN GW shall\nact as the DHCP server towards the UE for both HPLMN assigned dynamic and\nstatic IP addressing and for VPLMN assigned dynamic IP addressing. When\nDHCP is used for external PDN assigned addressing and parameter\nconfiguration, the PDN GW shall act as the DHCP server towards the UE and\nit shall act as the DHCP client towards the external DHCP server. The\nServing GW does not have any DHCP functionality. It forwards packets,\nincluding DHCP packets, between the UE and the PDN GW.\n\nIPv6 Stateless Address autoconfiguration specified in RFC\u00a04862\u00a0[18] is the\nbasic mechanism to allocate /64 IPv6 prefix to the UE.\n\nDuring default bearer establishment, the PDN GW sends the IPv6 prefix and\nInterface Identifier to the S-GW, and then the S-GW forwards the IPv6\nprefix and Interface Identifier to the MME or to the SGSN. The MME or the\nSGSN forwards the IPv6 Interface Identifier to the UE. The MME does not\nforward the IPv6 prefix to the UE. If the UE receives the IPv6 prefix from\nthe SGSN during PDP Context Activation procedure, it shall ignore it.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "IP address allocation, renewal and release mechanisms for GTP", "numbering": "5.3.1.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "IPv address allocation via default bearer activation and", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.1", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Allocation, renewal and release of the IPv default prefix via", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.2", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "IPv parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "IPv address allocation, renewal and release and IPv parameter", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.3.1.2  IP address allocation, renewal and release mechanisms for GTP\n           based S5/S8\n\n\n5.3.1.2.1   IPv4 address allocation via default bearer activation and\n             release via PDN connection release\n\nAn IPv4 address may be provided to the UE as part of the default bearer\nactivation and the IPv4 address is released when PDN connection associated\nwith the IPv4 address is released.\n\nWhen the PLMN allocates an IPv4 address, it is the PDN\u00a0GW responsibility to\nallocate and release the IPv4 address. The PDN GW may use an internal IPv4\naddress pool in this case. The PDN GW allocates an IPv4 address upon\ndefault bearer activation and it releases the IPv4 address upon PDN\nconnection release associated with the IPv4 address for a given UE.\n\n  NOTE:  If the PDN type is IPv4v6, when the PDN Connection is released,\n         the IPv6 address is also released.\n\nWhen an IPv4 address is allocated from an external PDN, it is the PDN GW\nresponsibility to obtain the IPv4 address from the external PDN, and to\nallocate, renew and release the IPv4 address. The PDN GW may use DHCPv4 to\nobtain, renew and release the IPv4 address from the external PDN. If RADIUS\nor Diameter is used towards the external PDN, as described in\nTS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38], the IP address can be obtained, renewed and released as\npart of these procedures. If DHCPv4 is used, the PDN GW functions as a\nDHCPv4 Client. If RADIUS is used, the PDN GW functions as a RADIUS Client.\nIf Diameter is used, the PDN GW functions as a Diameter Client.\n\nAfter releasing the IPv4 address, the PDN GW should not assign that IPv4\naddress to other user immediately.\n\n\n5.3.1.2.2   Allocation, renewal and release of the IPv6 default prefix via\n             IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration\n\nWhen the PLMN allocates an IPv6 prefix, it is the PDN GW responsibility to\nallocate and release the IPv6 prefix. The PDN GW may use an internal IPv6\nprefix pool in this case. The PDN GW allocates a globally unique /64 IPv6\nprefix via Router Advertisement to a given UE.\n\nWhen an IPv6 prefix is allocated from an external PDN, it is the PDN GW\nresponsibility to obtain the IPv6 prefix from the external PDN and to\nallocate, renew and release the IPv6 prefix. The PDN GW may use DHCPv6 to\nobtain the IPv6 prefix from the external PDN. In this case, the PDN GW\nfunctions as a DHCPv6 client. If RADIUS or Diameter is used towards the\nexternal PDN as described in TS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38], the IPv6 prefix can be\nobtained, renewed and released as part of these procedures. If RADIUS is\nused, the PDN GW functions as the RADIUS Client. If Diameter is used, the\nPDN GW functions as the Diameter Client.\n\nThe procedure of stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration is the following:\nAfter default bearer establishment the UE may send a Router Solicitation\nmessage to the PDN GW to solicit a Router Advertisement message. The PDN\u00a0GW\nsends a Router Advertisement message (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE.\nThe Router Advertisement messages shall contain the same IPv6 prefix as the\none provided during default bearer establishment. If the UE receives an\nIPv6 prefix from a SGSN during the PDP Context activation procedure, it\nshall ignore it.\n\nAfter the UE has received the Router Advertisement message, it constructs a\nfull IPv6 address via IPv6 Stateless Address autoconfiguration in\naccordance with RFC\u00a04862\u00a0[18]. To ensure that the link-local address\ngenerated by the UE does not collide with the link-local address of the PDN\nGW, the PDN GW shall provide an interface identifier (see RFC\u00a04862\u00a0[18]) to\nthe UE and the UE shall use this interface identifier to configure its link-\nlocal address. For stateless address autoconfiguration however, the UE can\nchoose any interface identifier to generate IPv6 addresses, other than link-\nlocal, without involving the network. However, the UE shall not use any\nidentifiers defined in TS\u00a023.003\u00a0[9] as the basis for generating the\ninterface identifier. For privacy, the UE may change the interface\nidentifier used to generate full IPv6 address, as defined in TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27]\nwithout involving the network.\n\nAny prefix that the PDN GW advertises to the UE is globally unique. The PDN\nGW shall also record the relationship between the UE's identity (IMSI) and\nthe allocated IPv6 prefix. Because any prefix that the PDN GW advertises to\nthe UE is globally unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate\nAddress Detection for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6\nprefix. Even if the UE does not need to use Neighbor Solicitation messages\nfor Duplicate Address Detection, the UE may, for example, use them to\nperform Neighbor Unreachability Detection towards the PDN GW, as defined in\nRFC\u00a04861\u00a0[32]. Therefore, the PDN GW shall respond with a Neighbor\nAdvertisement upon receiving a Neighbor Solicitation message from the UE.\n\nIn order to renew the allocated IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW sends a Router\nAdvertisement (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE with the same prefix and\nnew non-zero values in preferred and valid lifetime fields.\n\nIn order to release the allocated IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW shall initiate\nthe PDN connection release procedure. Upon release of the PDN connection,\nthe UE shall implicitly release the prefix for the corresponding PDN\nconnection.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the PDN type is IPv4v6, when the PDN Connection is released,\n         the IPv4 address is also released.\n\nAfter releasing the IPv6 prefix, the PDN GW should not assign that IPv6\nprefix to other user immediately.\n\n\n5.3.1.2.3   IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6\n\nThe UE may use stateless DHCPv6 for additional parameter configuration. The\nPDN GW acts as the DHCP server. When PLMN based parameter configuration is\nused, the PDN GW provides the requested parameters from locally provisioned\ndatabase. When external PDN based parameter configuration is used, the PDN\nGW obtains the requested configuration parameters from the external PDN as\ndescribed in the previous clauses. When the PDN GW acts as a DHCPv6 server\ntowards the UE, the PDN GW may act as DHCPv6 client towards the external\nPDN to request the configuration parameters for the UE. If RADIUS or\nDiameter is used towards the external PDN as described in TS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38],\nthe requested configuration parameters can be fetched as part of these\nprocedures.\n\n\n5.3.1.2.4   IPv4 address allocation, renewal and release and IPv4 parameter\n             configuration via DHCPv4\n\nWhen the PLMN allocates an IPv4 address, it is the PDN GW responsibility to\nallocate, renew and release the IPv4 address.\n\nWhen external PDN allocation is used, the PDN GW functions as a DHCPv4\nserver towards the UE. The PDN GW may act as a DHCP Client when interacting\nwith a DHCPv4 server in the external PDN in order to obtain, renew and\nrelease the IPv4 address and to obtain the configuration parameters. Or, if\nRADIUS or Diameter is used towards the external PDN as described in\nTS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38], the IPv4 address and the requested configuration parameters\ncan be obtained, renewed and released as part of these procedures.\n\nIf dynamic policy provisioning is deployed, and the PCRF was not informed\nabout the IPv4 address at IP-CAN session establishment, the PDN GW shall\ninitiate an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure to inform the PCRF about\nan allocated IPv4 address. If the IPv4 address is released, the PDN GW\nshall inform the PCRF about the de-allocation of an IPv4 address.\n\nIf the UE sends DHCPv4 lease renewal message to renew the lease of the\nallocated IPv4 address, the PDN GW shall renew the lease of the allocated\nIPv4 address. If the IPv4 address was obtained from an external PDN, the\nPDN GW shall perform the DHCPv4 lease renewal procedure with the external\nPDN if DHCPv4 was used for obtaining IPv4 address from external PDN. If\nDiameter or RADIUS procedures where used to obtain the IPv4 address from\nexternal PDN, the PDN GW may perform corresponding update procedures as\napplicable. If the external PDN extends lease of the allocated IPv4\naddress, the PDN GW responds accordingly to the UE. Otherwise, if the\nexternal PDN does not extend the lease of the allocated IPv4 address, the\nPDN GW responds with the remaining lease time of the IPv4 address. If there\nis no PDN address allocated to the UE for this PDN connection, the PDN GW\nshall perform PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation procedure as defined in\nclause\u00a05.4.4.1.\n\nIf the UE sends DHCPv4 release message to release the allocated IPv4\naddress for the PDN connection, the PDN GW may anytime thereafter release\nthe IPv4 address. If the PDN connection has no allocated PDN address, the\nPDN GW may at any time initiate PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation\nprocedure as defined in clause\u00a05.4.4.1.\n\n  NOTE:  If the PDN type is IPv4v6 the release of the allocated IPv4\n         address does not mean that there is no allocated PDN address for\n         the PDN connection, as the IPv6 prefix still remains allocated to\n         that PDN connection.\n\nIf the PDN connection is released without any DHCPv4 release signalling\nwith the UE, the UE and the PDN GW shall release the IPv4 address\nimplicitly, as soon as the PDN connection is released.\n\nAfter releasing the IPv4 address, the PDN GW should not assign that IPv4\naddress to any other user immediately.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Void", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.5", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "IPv Prefix Delegation via DHCPv", "numbering": "5.3.1.2.6", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.3.1.2.5   Void\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2.6   IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6\n\nOptionally a single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix may\nbe assigned to a PDN connection.

A UE, camping on an E-UTRAN cell reads the related System Information\n    Broadcast.\n\n     An E-UTRAN cell for a PLMN that supports CIoT enhancements shall\n    broadcast:\n\n     For the NB-IoT case:\n\n    -  Whether it can connect to an MME which supports EPS Attach without\n       PDN Connectivity.\n\n     For the WB-E-UTRAN case:\n\n    -  Whether it supports Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and it can\n       connect to an MME which supports Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n\n    -  Whether it supports User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and it can\n       connect to an MME which supports User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n\n    -  Whether it can connect to an MME which supports EPS Attach without\n       PDN Connectivity.\n\n     If the PLMN does not advertise support of EPS attach without PDN\n    connectivity and the UE can only attach without PDN connectivity, then\n    the UE shall not attach to the PLMN in this cell and shall proceed as\n    specified in TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\n     In the case of WB-E-UTRAN, if the PLMN does not support Control Plane\n    CIoT EPS Optimisation, and the UE only supports Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation and cannot otherwise attach, then the UE shall not proceed\n    with the Attach to the PLMN in this cell and shall proceed as specified\n    in TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\n     An E-UTRAN cell for a PLMN that supports Restricted Local Operator\n    Service shall broadcast:\n\n    -  Whether it supports Restricted Local Operator Service.\n\n     If the PLMN does not advertise support for Restricted Local Operator\n    Services, the UE shall not proceed with the Attach with indication that\n    the attach is to receive Restricted Local Operator Services to the PLMN\n    in this cell.\n\n     If a Service Gap timer is running in the UE (see clause\u00a04.3.17.9) and\n    the Attach Type is not Emergency Attach and it is not an Attach without\n    PDN connectivity, then the UE shall not send Attach Requests to this\n    PLMN or any other PLMN as long as the timer is running.\n\n     If the UE can proceed to attach, it initiates the Attach procedure by\n    the transmission, to the eNodeB, of an Attach Request (IMSI or old\n    GUTI, Old GUTI type, last visited TAI (if available), UE Core Network\n    Capability, UE Specific DRX parameters, extended idle mode DRX\n    parameters, Attach Type, ESM message container (Request Type, PDN Type,\n    Protocol Configuration Options, Ciphered Options Transfer Flag, Header\n    Compression Configuration), KSIASME, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC,\n    additional GUTI, P-TMSI signature, Voice domain preference and UE's\n    usage setting, Preferred Network behaviour, MS Network Capability,\n    Support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, UE has UE Radio\n    Capability ID assigned for the selected PLMN) message together with RRC\n    parameters indicating the Selected Network and the old GUMMEI.\n\n     In the RRC connection establishment signalling associated with the\n    Attach Request, the UE indicates its support of the CIoT EPS\n    Optimisations, relevant for MME selection.\n\n     If the UE identifies itself with the old GUTI, the UE shall set the\n    Old GUTI Type to indicate whether the Old GUTI is a native GUTI or is\n    mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI. The old GUTI may be derived from a P-TMSI\n    and RAI. IMSI shall be included if the UE does not have a valid GUTI or\n    a valid P-TMSI available, or if the UE is configured to perform Attach\n    with IMSI at PLMN change and is accessing a new PLMN. The UE stores the\n    TIN in detached state. If the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" or \"RAT-related\n    TMSI\" and the UE holds a valid GUTI then the old GUTI indicates this\n    valid GUTI. If the UE's TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the UE holds a valid\n    P-TMSI and related RAI then these two elements are indicated as the old\n    GUTI. Mapping a P-TMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in TS\u00a023.003\u00a0[9].\n    If the UE holds a valid GUTI and the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped\n    from a P-TMSI and RAI, then the UE indicates the GUTI as additional\n    GUTI. If the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI and\n    the UE has a valid P-TMSI signature associated to it, the P-TMSI\n    signature shall be included. The UE sets the voice domain preference\n    and UE's usage setting according to its configuration, as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.9.\n\n     Alternatively, when a UE only supports E-UTRAN, if the UE has a GUTI\n    available and the UE is accessing the same PLMN (or ePLMN), then it\n    identifies itself with the old GUTI and sets the Old GUTI Type to\n    'native', otherwise the UE configuration determines whether the UE\n    identifies itself with its IMSI or the Old GUTI.\n\n     The UE includes the extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element if the UE needs to enable extended idle mode DRX.\n\n     If available, the last visited TAI shall be included in order to help\n    the MME produce a good list of TAIs for any subsequent Attach Accept\n    message. Selected Network indicates the PLMN that is selected for\n    network sharing purposes. The RRC parameter \"old GUMMEI\" takes its\n    value from the \"old GUTI\" contained in the Attach Request. UE Network\n    Capability is described in UE capabilities, see clause\u00a05.11.\n\n     If the UE has valid security parameters, the Attach Request message\n    shall be integrity protected by the NAS-MAC in order to allow\n    validation of the UE by the MME. KSIASME, NAS sequence number and NAS-\n    MAC are included if the UE has valid EPS security parameters. NAS\n    sequence number indicates the sequential number of the NAS message. If\n    the UE does not have a valid EPS security association, then the Attach\n    Request message is not integrity protected. In this case the security\n    association is established in step\u00a05a. The UE network capabilities\n    indicate also the supported NAS and AS security algorithms.\n\n     PDN type indicates the requested IP version (IPv4, IPv4/IPv6, IPv6).\n    For a UE that support CIoT EPS Optimisations, the PDN type may also be\n    \"Non-IP\". PDN type may also indicate Ethernet.\n\n     Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) are used to transfer parameters\n    between the UE and the PDN GW, and sent transparently through the MME\n    and the Serving GW. The Protocol Configuration Options may include the\n    Address Allocation Preference indicating that the UE prefers to obtain\n    an IPv4 address only after the default bearer activation by means of\n    DHCPv4. If the UE intends to send PCO which require ciphering (e.g.,\n    PAP/CHAP usernames and passwords) or send an APN, or both, the UE shall\n    set the Ciphered Options Transfer Flag and send PCO or APN or both only\n    after authentication and NAS security setup have been completed (see\n    below).\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  External network operators wanting to use PAP for authentication\n         are warned that PAP is an obsolete protocol from a security point\n         of view. CHAP provides stronger security than PAP.\n\n     If the UE supports 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall include in the PCO the\n    3GPP PS Data Off UE Status, which indicates whether the user has\n    activated or deactivated 3GPP PS Data Off.\n\n     If the UE has UTRAN or GERAN capabilities, it shall send the NRSU in\n    the PCO to indicate the support of the network requested bearer control\n    in UTRAN/GERAN. The UE sends the ETFTU in the PCO to indicate the\n    support of the extended TFT filter format. Request Type is included in\n    the ESM message container and indicates \"Handover\" when the UE has\n    already an activated PDN GW/HA due to mobility with non-3GPP accesses.\n\n     If a UE indicates support of CIoT EPS Optimisations in the RRC\n    message, it may omit the ESM message container. If the ESM message\n    container is omitted the MME shall not establish a PDN connection as\n    part of the Attach procedure. In this case steps 6, 12 to 16 and 23 to\n    26 are not executed. In addition, for the case of UEs attaching with\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation with no user plane establishment,\n    steps 17 to 22 are replaced by S1 AP NAS Transport and RRC Direct\n    Transfer messages that just transport the NAS Attach Accept and NAS\n    Attach Complete messages.\n\n     Attach Type indicates whether it is an EPS attach or a combined\n    EPS/IMSI attach or an Emergency Attach or an RLOS Attach. Emergency\n    Attach and RLOS Attach shall not be indicated when the UE is using NB-\n    IoT. When using CIoT EPS Optimisations, the UE may indicate EPS attach\n    and request SMS by setting the \"SMS transfer without Combined Attach\"\n    flag in the Preferred Network Behaviour IE.\n\n     If a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the\n    Network Behaviour the UE is expecting to be available in the network as\n    defined in clause\u00a04.3.5.10.\n\n     If a UE indicated Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation supported in\n    Preferred Network Behavior, and the UE included the ESM message\n    container, and the PDN type was IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6, and the UE\n    supports header compression, it shall include the Header Compression\n    Configuration. The Header Compression Configuration includes the\n    information necessary for the ROHC channel setup. Optionally, the\n    Header Compression Configuration may include additional header\n    compression context setup parameters if the UE already has the\n    application traffic information, e.g. the target server IP address.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach the UE shall set both the Attach Type and the\n    Request Type to \"Emergency\" and the IMSI shall be included if the UE\n    does not have a valid GUTI or a valid P-TMSI available. The IMEI shall\n    be included when the UE has no IMSI, no valid GUTI and no valid P-TMSI.\n\n     For RLOS attach, the UE shall set the Attach Type to \"RLOS\" and the\n    Request Type to \"RLOS\", the IMSI shall be included if available. The\n    IMEI shall be included when the UE has no IMSI, no valid GUTI and no\n    valid P-TMSI.\n\n     If the UE supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a, and if the UE is\n    provisioned with a UE Radio Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN\n    (i.e.PLMN-assigned for the specific PLMN or manufacturer-assigned), the\n    UE includes a flag that indicates it has an assigned UE Radio\n    Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN but the actual UE Radio\n    Capability is provided to MME after security context is established in\n    step\u00a06 (see below).\n\n  2. The eNodeB derives the MME address from the RRC parameters carrying\n    the old GUMMEI, the indicated Selected Network and the RAT (NB-IoT or\n    WB-E-UTRAN). If that MME is not associated with the eNodeB or the old\n    GUMMEI is not available, the eNodeB selects an MME as described in\n    clause 4.3.8.3 on \"MME selection function\". The eNodeB forwards the\n    Attach Request message in a S1-MME control message (Initial UE message)\n    together with the Selected Network, CSG access mode, CSG ID, L-GW\n    address, TAI+ECGI of the cell from where it received the message to the\n    new MME. CSG ID is provided if the UE attaches via a CSG cell or hybrid\n    cell. CSG access mode is provided if the UE attaches via a hybrid cell.\n    If the CSG access mode is not provided but the CSG ID is provided, the\n    MME shall consider the cell as a CSG cell. If the eNodeB has a\n    collocated L-GW, it includes the L-GW address in the Initial UE message\n    to the MME.\n\n     If the MME is not configured to support Emergency Attach the MME shall\n    reject any Attach Request that indicates Attach Type \"Emergency\".\n\n     If the MME is not configured to support RLOS Attach, the MME shall\n    reject any Attach Request that indicates Attach Type \"RLOS\".\n\n     If the UE has included the Preferred Network Behaviour, and what the\n    UE indicated it supports in Preferred Network Behaviour is incompatible\n    with the network support e.g. the UE indicated support only for Control\n    Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and the MME only supports User Plane CIoT\n    EPS Optimisation, the MME shall reject the Attach Request with an\n    appropriate cause value (e.g. one that avoids retries on this PLMN).\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB indicates the UE's Coverage Level\n    to the MME.\n\n  3. If the UE identifies itself with GUTI and the MME has changed since\n    detach, the new MME determines the type of the old node, i.e. MME or\n    SGSN, as specified in clause\u00a04.3.19, uses the GUTI received from the UE\n    to derive the old MME/SGSN address, and sends an Identification Request\n    (old GUTI, complete Attach Request message) to the old MME/SGSN to\n    request the IMSI. If the request is sent to an old MME, the old MME\n    first verifies the Attach Request message by NAS MAC and then responds\n    with Identification Response (IMSI, MM Context). If the request is sent\n    to an old SGSN, the old SGSN first verifies the Attach Request message\n    by the P-TMSI signature and then responds with Identification Response\n    (MM Context). If the UE is not known in the old MME/SGSN or if the\n    integrity check or P-TMSI signature check for the Attach Request\n    message fails, the old MME/SGSN responds with an appropriate error\n    cause. The MM context contains security related information as well as\n    other parameters (including IMSI) as described in clause\u00a05.7.2\n    (Information Storage for MME).\n\n     The additional GUTI in the Attach Request message allows the new MME\n    to find any already existing UE context stored in the new MME when the\n    old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach or a RLOS Attach, if the UE identifies itself\n    with a temporary identity that is not known to the MME the MME\n    immediately requests the IMSI from the UE. If the UE identifies itself\n    with IMEI, the IMSI request shall be skipped.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  A SGSN always responds with the UMTS security parameters and the\n         MME may store it for later use.\n\n  4. If the UE is unknown in both the old MME/SGSN and new MME, the new MME\n    sends an Identity Request to the UE to request the IMSI. The UE\n    responds with Identity Response (IMSI).\n\n  5a If no UE context for the UE exists anywhere in the network, if the\n    Attach Request (sent in step 1) was not integrity protected, or if the\n    check of the integrity failed, then authentication and NAS security\n    setup to activate integrity protection and NAS ciphering are mandatory.\n    Otherwise it is optional. If NAS security algorithm is to be changed,\n    the NAS security setup is performed in this step. The authentication\n    and NAS security setup functions are defined in clause\u00a05.3.10 on\n    \"Security Function\".\n\n     If the UE supports RACS as indicated in the UE Network Capability, and\n    if the UE indicated that it is provisioned with UE Radio Capability ID\n    for the selected PLMN then authentication and NAS security setup to\n    activate integrity protection and NAS ciphering are mandatory. The MME\n    shall request the UE to provide the UE Radio Capability ID in Security\n    Mode Command and the UE shall include the UE Radio Capability ID in\n    Security Mode Command Accept for the supported UE radio capabilities.\n\n     If the MME is configured to support Emergency Attach for\n    unauthenticated IMSIs and the UE indicated Attach Type \"Emergency\" the\n    MME skips the authentication and security setup or the MME accepts that\n    the authentication may fail and continues the attach procedure.\n\n     If the MME is configured to support RLOS Attach and the UE indicated\n    Attach Type \"RLOS\", based on local regulation and operator policy, the\n    MME may skip the authentication and security setup, or the MME may\n    perform authentication if security information is available or\n    obtainable from HSS and continues the attach procedure regardless of\n    the authentication result.\n\n     After step\u00a05a, all NAS messages shall be protected by the NAS security\n    functions (integrity and ciphering) indicated by the MME unless the UE\n    is emergency attached and not successfully authenticated.\n\n  5b.  The ME Identity (IMEISV) shall be retrieved from the UE. The ME\n    identity shall be transferred encrypted unless the UE performs\n    Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach and cannot be authenticated.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach, the UE may have included the\n    IMEI in the Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach. If so, the ME Identity\n    retrieval is skipped.\n\n     In order to minimise signalling delays, the retrieval of the ME\n    Identity may be combined with NAS security setup in step\u00a05a. The MME\n    may send the ME Identity Check Request (ME Identity, IMSI) to the EIR.\n    The EIR shall respond with ME Identity Check Ack (Result). Dependent\n    upon the Result, the MME decides whether to continue with this Attach\n    procedure or to reject the UE.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach, the IMEI check to the EIR may\n    be performed. If the IMEI is blocked, operator policies determine\n    whether the Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach procedure continues or is\n    stopped.\n\n     If the UE supports RACS, as indicated in the UE Core Network\n    Capability IE, the MME shall use the IMEI of the UE to obtain the TAC\n    for the purpose of RACS operation.\n\n  6. If the UE has set the Ciphered Options Transfer Flag in the Attach\n    Request message, the Ciphered Options i.e. PCO or APN or both, shall\n    now be retrieved from the UE.\n\n     In order to handle situations where the UE may have subscriptions to\n    multiple PDNs, if the Protocol Configuration Options contains user\n    credentials (e.g. user name/password within PAP or CHAP parameters)\n    then the UE should also send the APN to the MME.\n\n  7. If there are active bearer contexts in the new MME for this particular\n    UE (i.e. the UE re-attaches to the same MME without having properly\n    detached before), the new MME deletes these bearer contexts by sending\n    Delete Session Request (LBI) messages to the GWs involved. The GWs\n    acknowledge with Delete Session Response (Cause) message. If a PCRF is\n    deployed, the PDN GW employs an IP-CAN Session Termination procedure to\n    indicate that resources have been released.\n\n  8. If the MME has changed since the last detach, or if there is no valid\n    subscription context for the UE in the MME, or if the UE provides an\n    IMSI or the UE provides an old GUTI which doesn't refer to a valid\n    context in the MME, or for some network sharing scenario (e.g. GWCN) if\n    the PLMN-ID of the TAI supplied by the eNodeB is different from that of\n    the GUTI in the UE's context, the MME sends an Update Location Request\n    (MME Identity, IMSI, ME Identity (IMEISV), MME Capabilities, ULR-Flags,\n    Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, UE SRVCC capability,\n    equivalent PLMN list) message to the HSS. The MME capabilities indicate\n    the MME's support for regional access restrictions functionality. ULR-\n    Flags indicates \"Initial-Attach-Indicator\" as this is an Attach\n    procedure. The inclusion of the equivalent PLMN list indicates that the\n    MME supports the inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in an equivalent\n    PLMN using the subscription information of the target PLMN. The\n    \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.8A) shall not be included unless the MME has completed its\n    evaluation of the support of \"IMS Voice over PS Session\" as specified\n    in clause\u00a04.3.5.8.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  At this step, the MME may not have all the information needed to\n         determine the setting of the IMS Voice over PS Session Supported\n         indication for this UE (see clause\u00a04.3.5.8). Hence the MME can send\n         the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" later on in\n         this procedure.\n\n     If the UE performs Initial or Handover Attach in a VPLMN supporting\n    Autonomous CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming\n    in the VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and the MME needs to\n    retrieve the CSG subscription information of the UE from the CSS, the\n    MME initiates the Update CSG Location Procedure with CSS as described\n    in clause\u00a05.3.12.\n\n     If the MME determines that only the UE SRVCC capability has changed,\n    the MME sends a Notify Request to the HSS to inform about the changed\n    UE SRVCC capability.\n\n     If there is a valid subscription context for the UE in the MME with a\n    Service Gap timer running and the Attach Type is not Emergency Attach\n    and it is not an Attach without PDN connectivity, the MME rejects the\n    Attach Request from the UE with an appropriate cause value. In\n    addition, MME may also provide a UE with a Mobility Management Back-off\n    Timer set to the remaining value of the Service Gap timer.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach in which the UE was not successfully\n    authenticated, the MME shall not send an Update Location Request to the\n    HSS.\n\n     For an RLOS Attach the MME shall not send an Update Location Request\n    to the HSS.\n\n  9. The HSS sends Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) to the old\n    MME. The old MME acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI) and\n    removes the MM and bearer contexts. If the ULR-Flags indicates \"Initial-\n    Attach-Indicator\" and the HSS has the SGSN registration, then the HSS\n    sends Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) to the old SGSN. The\n    Cancellation Type indicates the old MME/SGSN to release the old Serving\n    GW resource.\n\n  10.  If there are active bearer contexts in the old MME/SGSN for this\n    particular UE, the old MME/SGSN deletes these bearer contexts by\n    sending Delete Session Request (LBI) messages to the GWs involved. The\n    GWs return Delete Session Response (Cause) message to the old MME/SGSN.\n    If a PCRF is deployed, the PDN GW employs an IP-CAN Session Termination\n    procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] to indicate that resources have\n    been released.\n\n  11.  The HSS acknowledges the Update Location message by sending an\n    Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription data) message to the new MME.\n    The Subscription Data contain one or more PDN subscription contexts.\n    Each PDN subscription context contains an 'EPS subscribed QoS profile'\n    and the subscribed APN-AMBR (see clause\u00a04.7.3) and the WLAN\n    offloadability indication (see clause\u00a04.3.23). The new MME validates\n    the UE's presence in the (new) TA.\n\n     If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions\n    (e.g. CSG restrictions) the UE is not allowed to attach in the TA or\n    due to subscription checking fails for other reasons, the new MME\n    rejects the Attach Request with an appropriate cause. If all checks are\n    successful then the new MME constructs a context for the UE. If the APN\n    provided by the UE is not allowed by subscription, based on operator\n    policy, the MME may reject the Attach Request from the UE with an\n    appropriate cause, or accept the Attach Request by replacing the UE\n    requested APN with a network supported APN. The MME uses that network\n    supported APN for the remainder of this procedure, except that the MME\n    provides to the UE the same APN that the UE requested. If the Update\n    Location is rejected by the HSS, the new MME rejects the Attach Request\n    from the UE with an appropriate cause.\n\n     The Subscription Data may contain CSG subscription information for the\n    registered PLMN and for the equivalent PLMN list requested by MME in\n    step\u00a08.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Enhanced Coverage Restricted\n    parameter. If received from the HSS, MME stores this Enhanced Coverage\n    Restricted parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Service Gap Time parameter. If\n    received from the HSS, MME stores this Service Gap Time in the MME MM\n    context and passes it to the UE in the Attach Accept message.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter that applies to the UEs on a specific RAT, e.g. NB-IoT. If\n    received from the HSS, MME stores this Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     If the UE provided APN is authorized for LIPA according to the user\n    subscription, the MME shall use the CSG Subscription Data to authorize\n    the connection.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach or RLOS Attach, the MME shall not check for\n    access restrictions, regional restrictions or subscription restrictions\n    (e.g. CSG restrictions). For an Emergency Attach, the MME shall ignore\n    any unsuccessful Update Location Response from HSS and continue with\n    the Attach procedure.\n\n  12.  If an ESM container was not included in the Attach Request, steps\n    12, 13,14,15,16 are skipped. If the attach type is not set to\n    \"Emergency\" or \"RLOS\", and the ESM container was included in the Attach\n    Request, and the UE has indicated support for Attach without PDN\n    Connectivity, and the network supports Attach without PDN Connectivity,\n    and the PDN Connection Restriction is set in the subscriber data, then\n    the new MME shall not establish PDN connection, and steps 12, 13, 14,\n    15 and 16 are skipped.\n\n     For an Emergency Attach the MME applies the parameters from MME\n    Emergency Configuration Data for the emergency bearer establishment\n    performed in this step and any potentially stored IMSI related\n    subscription data are ignored by the MME.\n\n     For a RLOS Attach, the MME applies the parameters from MME RLOS\n    Configuration Data for the RLOS default bearer establishment performed\n    in this step and any potentially stored IMSI related subscription data\n    are ignored by the MME.\n\n     If the UE performs Initial or Handover Attach via a CSG cell and there\n    is no subscription for that CSG or the CSG subscription is expired the\n    MME shall reject the Attach Request with an appropriate cause. If the\n    UE has this CSG ID and associated PLMN on its Allowed CSG list the UE\n    shall remove the CSG ID and associated PLMN from the list when\n    receiving this reject cause.\n\n     If a subscribed PDN address is allocated for the UE for this APN, the\n    PDN subscription context contains the UE's IPv4 address and/or the IPv6\n    prefix and optionally the PDN GW identity. If the PDN subscription\n    context contains a subscribed IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, the MME\n    indicates it in the PDN address. For Request Type indicating \"Initial\n    request\", if the UE does not provide an APN, the MME shall use the PDN\n    GW corresponding to the default APN for default bearer activation. If\n    the UE provides an APN, this APN shall be employed for default bearer\n    activation. For Request Type indicating \"Handover\", if the UE provides\n    an APN, the MME shall use the PDN GW corresponding to the provided APN\n    for default bearer activation, If the UE does not provide an APN, and\n    the subscription context from HSS contains a PDN GW identity\n    corresponding to the default APN, the MME shall use the PDN GW\n    corresponding to the default APN for default bearer activation. The\n    case where the Request Type indicates \"Handover\" and the UE does not\n    provide an APN, and the subscription context from HSS does not contain\n    a PDN GW identity corresponding to the default APN constitutes an error\n    case. If the Request Type indicates \"Initial request\" and the selected\n    PDN subscription context contains no PDN GW identity the new MME\n    selects a PDN GW as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.1 on PDN GW selection\n    function (3GPP accesses). If the PDN subscription context contains a\n    dynamically allocated PDN GW identity and the Request Type does not\n    indicate \"Handover\" the MME may select a new PDN GW as described in\n    clause PDN GW selection function, e.g. to allocate a PDN GW that allows\n    for more efficient routing.\n\n     For initial and handover Emergency Attach the MME uses the PDN GW\n    Selection function defined in clause\u00a04.3.12.4 to select a PDN GW.\n\n     For initial RLOS Attach, the MME uses the PDN GW Selection function\n    defined in clause\u00a04.3.12a.4 to select a PDN GW.\n\n     If the subscription context does not indicate that the APN is for a\n    PDN connection to an SCEF, the new MME selects a Serving GW as\n    described in clause 4.3.8.2 on Serving GW selection function and\n    allocates an EPS Bearer Identity for the Default Bearer associated with\n    the UE. Then it sends a Create Session Request (IMSI, MSISDN, MME TEID\n    for control plane, PDN GW address, PDN Address, APN, RAT type, LTE-M\n    RAT type reporting to PGW flag, Default EPS Bearer QoS, PDN Type, APN-\n    AMBR, EPS Bearer Identity, Protocol Configuration Options, Handover\n    Indication, ME Identity (IMEISV), User Location Information (ECGI), UE\n    Time Zone, User CSG Information, MS Info Change Reporting support\n    indication, Selection Mode, Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference,\n    Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity, Maximum APN Restriction, Dual\n    Address Bearer Flag, the Protocol Type over S5/S8, Serving Network, APN\n    Rate Control Status) message to the selected Serving GW. If Control\n    Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies, then the MME shall also indicate\n    S11-U tunnelling of NAS user data and send its own S11-U IP address and\n    MME DL TEID for DL data forwarding by the SGW. User CSG Information\n    includes CSG ID, access mode and CSG membership indication.\n\n     For PDN type \"non-IP\" when Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisations are\n    enabled for the UE, if APN subscription data indicate a SCEF connection\n    needs to be used, then the MME allocates an EPS Bearer Identity for the\n    Default Bearer associated with the UE and establishes a connection to\n    the SCEF address indicated in subscription data as per TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]\n    and the steps 12,13,14,15,16 are not executed. The rest of the\n    interactions with the UE apply as specified below.\n\n     If the MME determines the PDN connection shall only use the Control\n    Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, the MME shall include a Control Plane Only\n    PDN Connection Indicator in Create Session Request.\n\n     If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency\" or \"RLOS\", Maximum APN\n    restriction control shall not be performed.\n\n     For emergency attached or RLOS attached UEs IMSI is included if\n    available and if the IMSI cannot be authenticated then the IMSI shall\n    be marked as unauthenticated.\n\n     The RAT type is provided in this message for the later PCC decision.\n    The RAT type shall distinguish between NB-IoT, LTE-M and WB-E-UTRA\n    types. The subscribed APN-AMBR for the APN is also provided in this\n    message. The MSISDN is included if provided in the subscription data\n    from the HSS. Handover Indication is included if the Request Type\n    indicates handover. Selection Mode indicates whether a subscribed APN\n    was selected, or a non-subscribed APN sent by the UE was selected.\n    Charging Characteristics indicates which kind of charging the bearer\n    context is liable for. The MME may change the requested PDN type\n    according to the subscription data for this APN as described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.1.1. The MME shall set the Dual Address Bearer Flag when the\n    PDN type is set to IPv4v6 and all SGSNs which the UE may be handed over\n    to are Release\u00a08 or above supporting dual addressing, which is\n    determined based on node pre-configuration by the operator. The\n    Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which protocol\n    should be used over S5/S8 interface.\n\n     The charging characteristics for the PS subscription and individually\n    subscribed APNs as well as the way of handling Charging Characteristics\n    and whether to send them or not to the P-GW is defined in\n    TS\u00a032.251\u00a0[44]. The MME shall include Trace Reference, Trace Type,\n    Trigger Id, and OMC Identity if S-GW and/or P-GW trace is activated.\n    The MME shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, and OMC Identity from\n    the trace information received from the HLR or OMC.\n\n     The Maximum APN Restriction denotes the most stringent restriction as\n    required by any already active bearer context. If there are no already\n    active bearer contexts, this value is set to the least restrictive type\n    (see clause 15.4 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]). If the P-GW receives the Maximum\n    APN Restriction, then the P-GW shall check if the Maximum APN\n    Restriction value does not conflict with the APN Restriction value\n    associated with this bearer context request. If there is no conflict\n    the request shall be allowed, otherwise the request shall be rejected\n    with sending an appropriate error cause to the UE.\n\n     If the MME requires the eNB to check whether the UE radio capabilities\n    are compatible with the network configuration (e.g. whether the SRVCC\n    or frequency support by the UE matches that of the network) to be able\n    to set the IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.8), then the MME may send a UE Radio Capability Match\n    Request to the eNB as defined in clause\u00a05.3.14.\n\n     The MME includes the latest APN Rate Control status if it has stored\n    it.\n\n  13.  The Serving GW creates a new entry in its EPS Bearer table and sends\n    a Create Session Request (IMSI, MSISDN, APN, Serving GW Address for the\n    user plane, Serving GW TEID of the user plane, Serving GW TEID of the\n    control plane, RAT type, Default EPS Bearer QoS, PDN Type, PDN Address,\n    subscribed APN-AMBR, EPS Bearer Identity, Protocol Configuration\n    Options, Handover Indication, ME Identity, User Location Information\n    (ECGI), UE Time Zone, User CSG Information, MS Info Change Reporting\n    support indication, PDN Charging Pause Support indication, Selection\n    Mode, Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger\n    Id, OMC Identity, Maximum APN Restriction, Dual Address Bearer Flag,\n    Serving Network, APN Rate Control Status) message to the PDN GW\n    indicated by the PDN GW address received in the previous step. After\n    this step, the Serving GW buffers any downlink packets it may receive\n    from the PDN GW without sending a Downlink Data Notification message to\n    the MME until it receives the Modify Bearer Request message in step 23\n    below. The MSISDN is included if received from the MME.\n\n     If the Serving GW has received the Control Plane Only PDN Connection\n    Indicator in step\u00a012, the Serving GW informs the PDN GW this\n    information in Create Session Request. The Serving GW and PDN GW shall\n    indicate the use of CP only on their CDRs.\n\n     PDN\u00a0GWs shall not perform any checks of Maximum APN Restriction if\n    Create Session Request includes the emergency APN or RLOS APN.\n\n     For emergency attached or RLOS attached UEs IMSI is included if\n    available and if the IMSI cannot be authenticated then the IMSI shall\n    be marked as unauthenticated.\n\n     In the case of handover attach, and if the PDN GW detects that the\n    3GPP PS Data Off UE Status is active, the PDN GW shall indicate this\n    status to the charging system for offline and online charging.\n\n  14.  If dynamic PCC is deployed and the Handover Indication is not\n    present, the PDN GW performs an IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure\n    as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], and thereby obtains the default PCC rules\n    for the UE. If the UE is accessing over WB-E-UTRA, this may lead to the\n    establishment of a number of dedicated bearers following the procedures\n    defined in clause 5.4.1 in association with the establishment of the\n    default bearer, which is described in Annex\u00a0F.\n\n     The IMSI, APN, UE IP address, User Location Information (ECGI), UE\n    Time Zone, Serving Network, RAT type, APN-AMBR, Default EPS Bearer QoS,\n    ETFTU (if ETFTU is not provided it means UE and/or the PDN\u00a0GW does not\n    support the extended TFT filter format) are provided to the PCRF by the\n    PDN GW if received by the previous message. The User Location\n    Information and UE Time Zone are used for location based charging. For\n    emergency attached or RLOS attached UEs which are unauthenticated the\n    PDN\u00a0GW provides the IMEI as the UE Identity instead of IMSI, to the\n    PCRF. If the PCRF decides that the PDN connection may use the extended\n    TFT filter format, it shall return the ETFTN indicator to the PDN\u00a0GW\n    for inclusion in the protocol Configuration Options returned to the UE.\n\n     The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and the QoS parameters (QCI and ARP)\n    associated with the default bearer in the response to the PDN GW as\n    defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If the PCC is configured to support emergency services and if dynamic\n    PCC is deployed, the PCRF, based on the emergency APN, sets the ARP of\n    the PCC rules to a value that is reserved for emergency services and\n    the authorization of dynamic PCC rules as described in of\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6]. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW uses the ARP\n    of the default emergency EPS bearer for any potentially initiated\n    dedicated emergency EPS bearer. The P-GW determines that emergency\n    services are requested based on the emergency APN received in Create\n    Session Request message.\n\n     If the PCC is configured to support Restricted Local Operator Services\n    and if dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF, based on the RLOS APN, sets\n    the ARP of the PCC rules to a value based on operator policy and the\n    authorization of dynamic PCC rules as described in of TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a010: While the PDN GW/PCEF may be configured to activate predefined\n         PCC rules for the default bearer, the interaction with the PCRF is\n         still required to provide e.g. the UE IP address information to the\n         PCRF.\n\n  NOTE\u00a011: If the IP address is not available when the PDN GW performs the\n         IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure with the PCRF, the PDN GW\n         initiates an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure to inform the\n         PCRF about an allocated IP address as soon as the address is\n         available. In this version of the specification, this is applicable\n         only to IPv4 address allocation.\n\n     If dynamic PCC is deployed and the Handover Indication is present, the\n    PDN GW executes a PCEF Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure\n    with the PCRF as specified in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] to report the new IP-CAN\n    type. Depending on the active PCC rules, the establishment of dedicated\n    bearers for the UE may be required. The establishment of those bearers\n    shall take place in combination with the default bearer activation as\n    described in Annex\u00a0F. This procedure can continue without waiting for a\n    PCRF response. If changes to the active PCC rules are required, the\n    PCRF may provide them after the handover procedure is finished.\n\n     In both cases (Handover Indication is present or not), if dynamic PCC\n    is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy. If the UE is\n    accessing over WB-E-UTRA, this may lead to the establishment of a\n    number of dedicated bearers for the UE following the procedures defined\n    in clause\u00a05.4.1 in combination with the establishment of the default\n    bearer, which is described in Annex\u00a0F.\n\n     If the CSG information reporting triggers are received from the PCRF,\n    the PDN\u00a0GW should set the CSG Information Reporting Action IE\n    accordingly.\n\n     If 3GPP PS Data Off status is received in the PCO from the UE and PDN\n    GW supports 3GPP PS Data Off, the PDN GW shall provide the 3GPP PS Data\n    Off status to the PCRF. If the PCRF supports 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall\n    return 3GPP PS Data Off support to the PDN GW for inclusion in the PCO\n    returned to the UE.\n\n     The additional behaviour of the PDN GW for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined\n    in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If received, the PDN GW may take the APN Rate Control Status into\n    account when encoding the APN Rate Control parameters in Protocol\n    Configuration Options and when enforcing the APN Rate Control as\n    described in clause\u00a04.7.7.3.\n\n  15.  The P-GW creates a new entry in its EPS bearer context table and\n    generates a Charging Id for the Default Bearer. The new entry allows\n    the P-GW to route user plane PDUs between the S-GW and the packet data\n    network, and to start charging. The way the P-GW handles Charging\n    Characteristics that it may have received is defined in TS\u00a032.251\u00a0[44].\n\n     The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the\n    user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control\n    plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS,\n    Protocol Configuration Options, Charging Id, Prohibit Payload\n    Compression, APN Restriction, Cause, MS Info Change Reporting Action\n    (Start) (if the PDN GW decides to receive UE's location information\n    during the session), CSG Information Reporting Action (Start) (if the\n    PDN GW decides to receive UE's User CSG information during the\n    session), Presence Reporting Area Action (if the PDN GW decides to\n    receive notifications about a change of UE presence in Presence\n    Reporting Area), PDN Charging Pause Enabled indication (if PDN GW has\n    chosen to enable the function), APN-AMBR, Delay Tolerant Connection)\n    message to the Serving GW.\n\n     The PDN GW takes into account the received PDN type, the Dual Address\n    Bearer Flag and the policies of operator when the PDN GW selects the\n    PDN type to be used as follows. If the received PDN type is IPv4v6 and\n    both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual\n    Address Bearer Flag is not set, or only single IP version addressing\n    for this APN is possible in the PDN, the PDN GW selects a single IP\n    version (either IPv4 or IPv6). If the received PDN type is IPv4 or IPv6\n    or \"Non-IP\" or \"Ethernet\", the PDN GW uses the received PDN type if it\n    is supported in the PDN, otherwise an appropriate error cause will be\n    returned. For IPv4, IPv6 and IPv4v6, the PDN GW allocates a PDN Address\n    according to the selected PDN type. If the PDN GW has selected a PDN\n    type different from the received PDN Type, the PDN GW indicates\n    together with the PDN type IE a reason cause to the UE why the PDN type\n    has been modified, as described in clause\u00a05.3.1.1. The PDN GW shall\n    either accept or reject (but not modify) the PDN type if the PDN type\n    is set to \"Non-IP\" or \"Ethernet\". PDN Address may contain an IPv4\n    address for IPv4 and/or an IPv6 prefix and an Interface Identifier, or\n    be omitted for PDN types \"Non-IP\" and \"Ethernet\". If the PDN has been\n    configured by the operator so that the PDN addresses for the requested\n    APN shall be allocated by usage of DHCPv4 only, or if the PDN GW allows\n    the UE to use DHCPv4 for address allocation according to the Address\n    Allocation Preference received from the UE, the PDN Address shall be\n    set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the IPv4 PDN address shall be\n    negotiated by the UE with DHCPv4 after completion of the Default Bearer\n    Activation procedure. For external PDN addressing for IPv6, the PDN GW\n    obtains the IPv6 prefix from the external PDN using either RADIUS or\n    Diameter client function. In the PDN Address field of the Create\n    Session Response, the PDN GW includes the Interface Identifier and IPv6\n    prefix. The PDN GW sends Router Advertisement to the UE after default\n    bearer establishment with the IPv6 prefix information for all cases.\n\n     If the PDN address is contained in the Create Session Request, the PDN\n    GW shall allocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix contained in the\n    PDN address to the UE. The IP address allocation details are described\n    in clause 5.3.1 on \"IP Address Allocation\". The PDN GW derives the BCM\n    based on the NRSU and operator policy. The PDN\u00a0GW derives whether the\n    extended TFT filter format is to be used based on the ETFTU, ETFTN\n    received from the PCRF and operator policy. Protocol Configuration\n    Options contains the BCM, ETFTN as well as optional PDN parameters that\n    the P-GW may transfer to the UE. These optional PDN parameters may be\n    requested by the UE, or may be sent unsolicited by the P-GW. Protocol\n    Configuration Options are sent transparently through the MME.\n\n     The PDN GW includes a Delay Tolerant Connection indication if the PDN\n    GW supports receiving a rejection cause from the SGW indicating that\n    the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving and holding\n    mobile terminated procedures, until the PDN GW receives a message\n    indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.\n\n     When the Handover Indication is present, the PDN GW does not yet send\n    downlink packets to the S-GW; the downlink path is to be switched at\n    step\u00a023a.\n\n     If the PDN GW is an L-GW, it does not forward downlink packets to the\n    S-GW. The packets will only be forwarded to the HeNB at step\u00a020 via the\n    direct user plane path.\n\n     If the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status was present in the Create Session\n    Request PCO and the network supports 3GPP PS Data Off feature, the PDN\n    GW shall include the 3GPP PS Data Off Support Indication in the Create\n    Session Response PCO.\n\n  16.  The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN Type, PDN\n    Address, Serving GW address for User Plane, Serving GW TEID User Plane,\n    Serving GW TEID for control plane, EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS,\n    PDN GW addresses and TEIDs (GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE keys (PMIP-based\n    S5/S8) at the PDN GW(s) for uplink traffic, Protocol Configuration\n    Options, Prohibit Payload Compression, APN Restriction, Cause, MS Info\n    Change Reporting Action (Start), Presence Reporting Area Action, CSG\n    Information Reporting Action (Start), APN-AMBR, Delay Tolerant\n    Connection) message to the new MME.\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies, and if the MME does\n    not include Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indicator in the Create\n    Session Request:\n\n    -  If separation of S11-U from S1-U is required, the Serving GW shall\n       include the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U and additionally\n       the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S1-U in Create Session\n       Response.\n\n    -  Otherwise, if separation of S11-U from S1-U is not required, the\n       Serving GW includes the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U in\n       Create Session Response.\n\n  17.  If an APN Restriction is received, then the MME shall store this\n    value for the Bearer Context and the MME shall check this received\n    value with the stored value for the Maximum APN Restriction to ensure\n    there are no conflicts between values. If the Bearer Context is\n    accepted, the MME shall determine a (new) value for the Maximum APN\n    Restriction. If there is no previously stored value for Maximum APN\n    Restriction, then the Maximum APN Restriction shall be set to the value\n    of the received APN Restriction. MME shall not deactivate bearer(s)\n    with emergency ARP, if present, to maintain valid APN restriction\n    combination.\n\n     The P-GW shall ignore Maximum APN restriction if the request includes\n    the Emergency APN.\n\n     If the MS Info Change Reporting Action (Start) and/or the CSG\n    Information Reporting Action (Start) are received for this bearer\n    context, then the MME shall store this for the bearer context and the\n    MME shall report to that P-GW via the S-GW whenever a UE's location\n    and/or User CSG information change occurs that meets the P-GW request,\n    as described in clause\u00a015.1.1a of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. If Presence Reporting\n    Area Action is received for this bearer context, the MME shall store\n    this information for the bearer context and shall report to that P-GW\n    via the S-GW whenever a change of UE presence in a Presence Reporting\n    Area is detected, as described in clause\u00a05.9.2.2.\n\n     The MME determines the UE AMBR to be used by the eNodeB based on the\n    subscribed UE-AMBR and the APN-AMBR for the default APN, see\n    clause\u00a04.7.3.\n\n     For emergency attach or RLOS attach the MME determines the UE-AMBR to\n    be used by the eNodeB from the APN AMBR received from the S-GW.\n\n     If new MME hasn't received, from Step 12, Voice Support Match\n    Indicator for the UE from the eNB then, based on implementation, the\n    MME may set IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication and update\n    it at a later stage.\n\n     The new MME sends an Attach Accept (GUTI, TAI List, Session Management\n    Request (APN, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Identity, Protocol\n    Configuration Options, Header Compression Configuration, Control Plane\n    Only Indicator), NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, IMS Voice over PS\n    session supported Indication, Emergency Service Support indicator, LCS\n    Support Indication, Supported Network Behaviour, Service Gap Time,\n    Enhanced Coverage Restricted, Indication for support of 15 EPS bearers\n    per UE) message to the eNodeB. GUTI is included if the new MME\n    allocates a new GUTI. PDN Type and PDN Address are omitted if the\n    Attach Request (step\u00a01) did not contain an ESM message container. The\n    MME indicates the CIoT EPS Optimisations it accepts in the Supported\n    Network Behaviour information as defined in clause\u00a04.3.5.10. Service\n    Gap Time is included if Service Gap Time is present in the subscription\n    information (step\u00a011) and the UE has indicated UE Service Gap Control\n    Capability. This message is contained in an S1_MME control message\n    Initial Context Setup Request, unless the MME has selected to use the\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, or, the UE did not include the ESM\n    message container in the Attach Request (step\u00a01), in which case an S1-\n    AP Downlink NAS transport message is used. The S1-AP Initial Context\n    Setup Request message also includes the AS security context information\n    for the UE, the Handover Restriction List, the EPS Bearer QoS, the UE-\n    AMBR, EPS Bearer Identity, as well as the TEID at the Serving GW used\n    for user plane and the address of the Serving GW for user plane and\n    whether User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation is allowed for the UE. If the\n    PDN type is set to \"Non-IP\" the MME includes it in the S1-AP Initial\n    Context Setup Request so that the eNodeB disables header compression.\n    If the PDN type is set to \"Ethernet\" the MME includes it in the S1-AP\n    Initial Context Setup Request so that any eNodeB header compression\n    functionality can act appropriately. In addition, if the PDN connection\n    is established for Local IP Access, the corresponding S1 Initial\n    Context Setup Request message includes a Correlation ID for enabling\n    the direct user plane path between the HeNB and the L-GW. If the PDN\n    connection is established for SIPTO at the Local Network with L-GW\n    function collocated with the (H)eNB, the corresponding S1-AP Initial\n    Context Setup Request message includes a SIPTO Correlation ID for\n    enabling the direct user plane path between the (H)eNB and the L-GW.\n    LIPA and SIPTO do not apply to Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a012: In this release of the 3GPP specification the Correlation ID and\n         SIPTO Correlation ID is set equal to the user plane PDN GW TEID\n         (GTP-based S5) or GRE key (PMIP-based S5) that the MME has received\n         in step\u00a016.\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies for an IP PDN\n    connection, and the UE has sent in the Attach Request the Header\n    Compression Configuration, and the MME supports the header compression\n    parameters, the MME shall include the Header Compression Configuration\n    in the PDN Connectivity Accept message. The MME also binds the uplink\n    and downlink ROHC channels to support header compression feedback\n    signalling. If the UE has included header compression context setup\n    parameters in Header Compression Configuration in the Attach Request,\n    the MME may acknowledge the header compression context setup\n    parameters. If the ROHC context is not established during the attach\n    procedure for the PDN connection, before using the compressed format\n    for sending the data, the UE and the MME need to establish the ROHC\n    context with ROHC IR packet based on Header Compression Configuration.\n\n     If the MME based on local policy determines the PDN connection shall\n    only use the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, the MME shall include\n    a Control Plane Only Indicator in the Session Management Request. For\n    PDN connections with an SCEF, the MME shall always include the Control\n    Plane Only Indicator.A UE receiving the Control Plane Only Indicator,\n    for a PDN connection shall only use the Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation for this PDN connection.\n\n     If the ESM container was not included in the Attach Request in step\u00a01,\n    then the Attach Accept message shall not include PDN related\n    parameters, and the Downlink NAS transfer S1-AP message shall not\n    include Access stratum context related information but may include CSG\n    related information.\n\n     If the attach type is not set to \"Emergency\", and the ESM container\n    was included in Attach Request in step\u00a01, and the UE indicated support\n    of Attach without PDN Connection in the Attach Request, and the MME\n    supports Attach without PDN Connection, and PDN connection restriction\n    is set in subscriber data, then the MME shall discard the ESM container\n    in the Attach Request message, and shall not include PDN related\n    parameters in the Attach Accept, but may include CSG related\n    information.\n\n     In the Attach Accept message, the MME does not include the IPv6 prefix\n    within the PDN Address. The MME includes the EPS Bearer QoS parameter\n    QCI and APN-AMBR into the Session Management Request. Furthermore, if\n    the UE has UTRAN or GERAN capabilities and the network supports\n    mobility to UTRAN or GERAN, the MME uses the EPS bearer QoS information\n    to derive the corresponding PDP context parameters QoS Negotiated (R99\n    QoS profile), Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id and TI and includes them\n    in the Session Management Request. If the UE indicated in the UE\n    Network Capability it does not support BSS packet flow procedures, then\n    the MME shall not include the Packet Flow Id. Handover Restriction List\n    is described in clause\u00a04.3.5.7 \"Mobility Restrictions\". The MME sets\n    the IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.8. LCS Support Indication indicates whether the network\n    supports the EPC-MO-LR and/or CS-MO-LR as described in TS\u00a023.271\u00a0[57].\n    The MME may include an indication whether the traffic of this PDN\n    Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN, as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.23. Indication for support of 15 EPS bearers per UE\n    indicates the network support for up to 15 EPS bearers per UE as\n    defined in clause\u00a04.12.\n\n     If the UE initiates the Attach procedure at a hybrid cell, the MME\n    shall check whether the CSG ID is contained in the CSG subscription and\n    is not expired. The MME shall send an indication whether the UE is a\n    CSG member to the RAN along with the S1-MME control message. Based on\n    this information the RAN may perform differentiated treatment for CSG\n    and non-CSG members.\n\n     If the MME or PDN GW has changed the PDN Type, an appropriate reason\n    cause shall be returned to the UE as described in clause\u00a05.3.1.1. If\n    the UE has indicated PDN type \"Non-IP\" or \"Ethernet\", the MME and PDN\n    GW shall not change PDN type.\n\n     For an emergency attached UE, i.e. for UEs that have only emergency\n    EPS bearers established, there is no AS security context information\n    included in the S1 control messages and there is no NAS level security\n    when the UE cannot be authenticated. The Emergency Service Support\n    indicator informs the UE that Emergency bearer services are supported,\n    i.e. the UE is allowed to request PDN connectivity for emergency\n    services.\n\n     For RLOS attached UEs, i.e. for UEs that have only RLOS PDN connection\n    established, there is no AS security context information included in\n    the S1 control messages and there is no NAS level security when the UE\n    cannot be successfully authenticated.\n\n     If the UE included extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element, the MME includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element if it decides to enable extended idle mode DRX with Paging Time\n    Window length assigned considering Subscribed Paging Time Window (if\n    available) and the local policy.\n\n     If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage\n    in step\u00a01, the MME sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the\n    eNB in S1-AP Initial Context Set-up Request message. MME also sends\n    Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the UE in the Attach Accept\n    message.\n\n     If the UE has indicated support for dual connectivity with NR in the\n    Attach Request and the UE is not allowed to use NR as Secondary RAT,\n    the MME indicates that to the UE in the Attach Accept message.\n\n     If RACS is supported in the MME and MME has received UE Radio\n    Capability ID earlier in this procedure, it signals the UE Radio\n    Capability ID to the eNB in S1-AP Initial Context Set-up Request\n    message. If the eNB does not have mapping between the specific UE Radio\n    Capability ID and the UE radio capabilities, it shall use the procedure\n    described in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36] to retrieve the mapping from the MME.\n\n  18.  If the eNodeB received an S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request the\n    eNodeB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message including the\n    EPS Radio Bearer Identity to the UE, and the Attach Accept message will\n    be sent along to the UE.\n\n     If the eNodeB received an S1-AP Downlink NAS Transport message (e.g.\n    containing the Attach Accept message), the eNode B sends a RRC Direct\n    Transfer message to the UE.\n\n     The UE shall store the QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id\n    and TI, which it received in the Session Management Request, for use\n    when accessing via GERAN or UTRAN. The APN is provided to the UE to\n    notify it of the APN for which the activated default bearer is\n    associated. For further details, see TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[37]. The UE may provide\n    EPS Bearer QoS parameters to the application handling the traffic\n    flow(s). The application usage of the EPS Bearer QoS is implementation\n    dependent. The UE shall not reject the RRC Connection Reconfiguration\n    on the basis of the EPS Bearer QoS parameters contained in the Session\n    Management Request.\n\n     If the UE receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter in the\n    Attach Accept message, UE shall store this information and shall use\n    the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to determine if\n    enhanced coverage feature should be used or not. If the UE receives a\n    Service Gap Time in the Attach Accept message, the UE shall store this\n    parameter and apply Service Gap Control (see clause\u00a04.3.17.9).\n\n     If the attach procedure is initiated by manual CSG selection and\n    occurs via a CSG cell, the UE upon receiving the Attach accept shall\n    check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN of the cell where the UE has\n    sent the Attach Request message is contained in its Allowed CSG list.\n    If the CSG ID and associated PLMN is not in the UE's Allowed CSG list,\n    the UE shall add the CSG ID and associated PLMN to its Allowed CSG\n    list. Manual CSG selection is not supported when an emergency service\n    has been initiated.\n\n  NOTE\u00a013: If the UE receives an Attach Accept message via a hybrid cell,\n         the UE does not add the corresponding CSG ID and associated PLMN to\n         its Allowed CSG list. Adding a CSG ID and associated PLMN to the\n         UE's local Allowed CSG list for a hybrid cell is performed only by\n         OTA or OMA DM procedures.\n\n     When receiving the Attach Accept message the UE shall set its TIN to\n    \"GUTI\" as no ISR Activated is indicated.\n\n     If the UE receives an IPv4 address set to 0.0.0.0, it may negotiate\n    the IPv4 address with DHCPv4 as specified in TS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38]. If the UE\n    receives an IPv6 interface identifier, it may wait for the Router\n    Advertisement from the network with the IPv6 prefix information or it\n    may send a Router Solicitation if necessary.\n\n  NOTE\u00a014: The IP address allocation details are described in clause 5.3.1\n         on \"IP Address Allocation\".\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies or the UE has not\n    included the ESM message container in the Attach Request in step\u00a01,\n    then the steps 19 and 20 are not executed.\n\n  19.  The UE sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to\n    the eNodeB. For further details, see TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[37].\n\n  20.  The eNodeB sends the Initial Context Response message to the new\n    MME. This Initial Context Response message includes the TEID of the\n    eNodeB and the address of the eNodeB used for downlink traffic on the\n    S1_U reference point.\n\n     The MME shall be prepared to receive this message either before or\n    after the Attach Complete message (sent in step\u00a022).\n\n     If the Correlation ID or SIPTO Correlation ID was included in the\n    Initial Context Setup Request message, the eNodeB shall use the\n    included information to establish direct user plane path with the L-GW\n    and forward uplink data for Local IP Access or SIPTO at the Local\n    Network with L-GW function collocated with the (H)eNB accordingly.\n\n  21.  The UE sends a Direct Transfer message to the eNodeB, which includes\n    the Attach Complete (EPS Bearer Identity, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC)\n    message. If the UE omitted the ESM message container from the Attach\n    Request message in step\u00a01, then the EPS Bearer Identity is omitted from\n    the Attach Complete message.\n\n  22.  The eNodeB forwards the Attach Complete message to the new MME in an\n    Uplink NAS Transport message.\n\n     If the ESM message container was included in step\u00a01, after the Attach\n    Accept message and once the UE has obtained (if applicable to the PDN\n    type) a PDN Address, the UE can then send uplink packets towards the\n    eNodeB which will then be tunnelled to the Serving GW and PDN GW. If\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisations apply, UL data is sent as\n    specified in clause\u00a05.3.4B. If the UE requested for a dual address PDN\n    type (IPv4v6) to a given APN and was granted a single address PDN type\n    (IPv4 or IPv6) by the network with a reason cause indicating that only\n    single IP version per PDN connection is allowed sent together with the\n    PDN type, the UE should request for the activation of a parallel PDN\n    connection to the same APN with a single address PDN type (IPv4 or\n    IPv6) other than the one already activated. If the UE receives no\n    reason cause in step\u00a018 in response to an IPv4v6 PDN type and it\n    receives an IPv6 Interface Identifier apart from the IPv4 address or\n    0.0.0.0 in the PDN Address field, it considers that the request for a\n    dual address PDN was successful. It can wait for the Router\n    Advertisement from the network with the IPv6 prefix information or it\n    may send Router Solicitation if necessary.\n\n  23.  Upon reception of both, the Initial Context Response message in\n    step\u00a020 and the Attach Complete message in step\u00a022, the new MME sends a\n    Modify Bearer Request (EPS Bearer Identity, eNodeB address, eNodeB\n    TEID, Handover Indication, Presence Reporting Area Information, RAT\n    type, LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW) message to the Serving GW. If\n    the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies and the PDN connection\n    is not served by a SCEF and if the MME does not need to report a change\n    of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, sending of Modify Bearer\n    Request and steps 23a, 23b and 24 are skipped; otherwise if the PDN\n    connection is served by SCEF, steps 23,24, 25, and 26 are not executed.\n    If the MME has been requested to report a change of UE presence in\n    Presence Reporting Area, the MME includes in this message the Presence\n    Reporting Area Information comprising the PRA identifier(s) and\n    indication(s) on whether the UE is inside or outside the area(s). When\n    receiving the request for reporting change of UE presence in Presence\n    Reporting Area, and the MME decides not to activate reporting UE\n    presence in one or more of the received Presence Reporting Area(s), the\n    MME reports also the inactive Presence Reporting Area(s) in this\n    message. The RAT type information element is included if the UE is\n    using the LTE-M RAT type. If PDN GW expects the LTE-M RAT type\n    reporting as specified in clause\u00a05.11.5, the MME also includes the LTE-\n    M RAT type reporting to PGW flag to indicate that the Serving GW needs\n    to forward the LTE-M RAT type to the PGW.\n\n  23a. If the Handover Indication is included in step 23, the Serving GW\n    sends a Modify Bearer Request (Handover Indication) message to the PDN\n    GW to prompt the PDN GW to tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to\n    3GPP access system and immediately start routing packets to the Serving\n    GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established. If\n    Presence Reporting Area Information is included in step\u00a023, the Serving\n    GW sends a Modify Bearer Request (Presence Reporting Area Information)\n    message to the PDN GW. If the LTE-M RAT type and the LTE-M RAT type\n    reporting to PGW flag were received at step\u00a023, the Serving GW shall\n    include the LTE-M RAT type in the Modify Bearer Request message to the\n    PGW. Otherwise the Serving GW includes RAT type WB-E-UTRAN.\n\n  NOTE\u00a015: The PDN GW is expected to handle the uplink packets sent by the\n         UE via 3GPP access after step\u00a022, even if they arrive before path\n         switch in step\u00a023.\n\n  NOTE\u00a016: The PDN GW forwards the Presence Reporting Area Information to\n         the PCRF, to the OCS or to both as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  23b. The PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the\n    Serving GW.\n\n  24.  The Serving GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response (EPS\n    Bearer Identity) message to the new MME. The Serving GW can then send\n    its buffered downlink packets.\n\n     If there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event or a\n    \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the EMM\n    Context of the MME, the MME sends an event notification (see\n    TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] for further information).\n\n  25.  After the MME receives Modify Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity)\n    message, if Request Type does not indicate handover and an EPS bearer\n    was established and the subscription data indicates that the user is\n    allowed to perform handover to non-3GPP accesses, and if the MME\n    selected a PDN GW that is different from the PDN GW identity which was\n    indicated by the HSS in the PDN subscription context, the MME shall\n    send a Notify Request including the APN and PDN GW identity to the HSS\n    for mobility with non-3GPP accesses. The message shall include\n    information that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN\u00a0GW is located.\n\n     If the ME identity of the UE has changed and step\u00a08 has not been\n    performed, the MME sends a Notify Request (ME Identity) message to\n    inform the HSS of the updated ME identity.\n\n     For an unauthenticated or roaming UE, if the Request Type of the UE\n    requested connectivity procedure indicates \"Emergency\", the MME shall\n    not send any Notify Request to an HSS. For a non-roaming authenticated\n    UE, based on operator configuration (e.g. on whether Voice over WLAN is\n    supported or not by the operator, on whether the operator uses a fixed\n    PDN GW for emergency calls, etc.), if the Request Type indicates\n    \"Emergency\", the MME may send a Notify Request to the HSS including the\n    \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", which comprises the\n    PDN GW address and an indication that the PDN connection is for\n    emergency services. The HSS shall store it as part of the UE context\n    for emergency services.\n\n     For any UEs, if Request Type of the UE requested connectivity\n    procedure indicates \"RLOS\", the MME shall not send any Notify Request\n    to an HSS.\n\n     After step\u00a08, and in parallel to any of the preceding steps, the MME\n    shall send a Notify Request (Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS\n    Sessions) message to the HSS:\n\n    -  If the MME has evaluated the support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions,\n       see clause\u00a04.3.5.8, and\n\n    -  If the MME determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous\n       Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause\u00a04.3.5.8A.\n\n  26.  In the case of non-emergency services, the HSS stores the APN and\n    PDN GW identity pair. In the case of emergency services, the HSS stores\n    the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\". The HSS then\n    sends a Notify Response to the MME.\n\n  NOTE\u00a017: For handover from non-3GPP access, the PDN GW initiates resource\n         allocation deactivation procedure in the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP\n         IP access as specified in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UTRAN/GERAN Initial Attach", "numbering": "5.3.2.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.2.2  UTRAN/GERAN Initial Attach\n\nWhen a UE attaches to UTRAN/GERAN, it executes the normal attach procedure\nas defined in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].

If the\n    UE has no other PDN connection, the MME initiates \"explicit detach with\n    reattach required\" procedure according to clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n  -  For Inter-MME/SGSN mobility, as part of the Tracking Area Update\n    procedure, the source MME shall remove the bearer(s) corresponding to\n    the SIPTO at Local Network PDN connection and shall release the core\n    network resources associated to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN\n    connection by performing the MME-initiated PDN Connection Deactivation\n    before sending the Context Response message.\n\n     For a stand-alone GW:\n\n  -  For intra-MME mobility, upon completion of the TAU procedure the MME\n    checks that the Local Home Network ID has changed and decides whether\n    to deactivate the SIPTO at the local Network PDN connection with the\n    \"reactivation requested\" cause value according to clause\u00a05.10.3. If the\n    UE has no other PDN connection, the MME initiates \"explicit detach with\n    reattach required\" procedure according to clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n  -  For Inter-MME/SGSN mobility, upon completion of the TAU/RAU procedure\n    the new MME/SGSN checks that the Local Home Network ID has changed and\n    decides whether to deactivate the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN\n    connection with the \"reactivation requested\" cause value according to\n    clause\u00a05.10.3. If the UE has no other PDN connection, the MME initiates\n    \"explicit detach with reattach required\" procedure according to\n    clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\nIf LIPA is active for a PDN connection of the UE, the source MME (or S4-\nSGSN) shall not include LIPA bearer(s) in the EPS bearer Context during\nTracking Area Update procedure and shall release the core network resources\nof this LIPA PDN connection by peforming the MME requested PDN\ndisconnection procedure according to steps\u00a02 to 6 of clause\u00a05.10.3 before\nit responds with the Context Response message in the case of inter-MME/SGSN\nmobility or after it receives Tracking Area Update Request in the case of\nintra-MME mobility.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The source MME may not be able to release the LIPA PDN\n         connection after the Context Response is sent as when there is no S-\n         GW relocation, the S-GW will assign the S11 control tunnel of the\n         UE to the new MME after the new MME updates the context\n         information.\n\nDuring the Tracking Area Update procedure, if the MME supports SRVCC and if\nthe UE SRVCC capability has changed, the MME informs the HSS with the UE\nSRVCC capability e.g. for further IMS registration.\n\nThe cell selection for UTRAN is described in TS\u00a025.304\u00a0[12] and\nTS\u00a025.331\u00a0[33].\n\nIf during the Tracking Area Update procedure the MME detects that the\nServing GW or/and the MME needs be relocated, the old MME may reject any\nPDN GW initiated EPS bearer(s) request received since the Tracking Area\nUpdate procedure started and if rejected, the old MME shall include an\nindication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to mobility\nprocedure in progress. The rejection is forwarded by the Serving GW to the\nPDN GW, with the indication that the request has been temporarily rejected.\n\nUpon reception of a rejection for an EPS bearer(s) PDN GW initiated\nprocedure with an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected\ndue to mobility procedure in progress, the PDN GW start a locally\nconfigured guard timer.

One of the triggers described in clause\u00a05.3.3.0 for starting the TAU\n    procedure occurs.\n\n  2. The UE initiates the TAU procedure by sending, to the eNodeB, a TAU\n    Request (UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability, Preferred\n    Network behaviour, Support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage,\n    old GUTI, Old GUTI type, last visited TAI, active flag, signalling\n    active flag, EPS bearer status, P-TMSI Signature, additional GUTI,\n    eKSI, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, KSI, Voice domain preference and\n    UE's usage setting, UE has UE Radio Capability ID assigned for the\n    selected PLMN) message together with RRC parameters indicating the\n    Selected Network and the old GUMMEI. An exception is that, if the TAU\n    was triggered for load re-balancing purposes (see clause\u00a04.3.7.3), the\n    old GUMMEI is not included in the RRC parameters. The UE shall set the\n    Old GUTI Type to indicate whether the Old GUTI is a native GUTI or is\n    mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.\n\n     If the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" and the UE\n    holds a valid GUTI then the old GUTI indicates this valid GUTI. If the\n    UE's TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and related\n    RAI then these two elements are indicated as the old GUTI. Mapping a P-\n    TMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in Annex\u00a0H. When the UE is in\n    connected mode (e.g. in URA_PCH) when it reselects to E-UTRAN, the UE\n    shall set its TIN to \"P-TMSI\".\n\n     If the UE holds a valid GUTI and the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped\n    from a P-TMSI and RAI, then the UE indicates the GUTI as additional\n    GUTI. If the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI,\n    and the UE has a valid P-TMSI signature, the P-TMSI signature shall be\n    included.\n\n     The additional GUTI in the Tracking Area Update Request message allows\n    the new MME to find any already existing UE context stored in the new\n    MME when the old GUTI indicates a value mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.\n\n     Alternatively, when a UE only supports E-UTRAN, it identifies itself\n    with the old GUTI and sets the Old GUTI Type to 'native'.\n\n     The RRC parameter \"old GUMMEI\" takes its value from the identifier\n    that is signalled as the old GUTI according to the rules above. For a\n    combined MME/SGSN the eNodeB is configured to route the MME-code(s) of\n    this combined node to the same combined node. This eNodeB is also\n    configured to route MME-code(s) of GUTIs that are generated by the UE's\n    mapping of the P-TMSIs allocated by the combined node. Such an eNodeB\n    configuration may also be used for separate nodes to avoid changing\n    nodes in the pool caused by inter RAT mobility.\n\n     The last visited TAI shall be included in order to help the MME\n    produce a good list of TAIs for any subsequent TAU Accept message.\n    Selected Network indicates the network that is selected. Active flag is\n    a request by UE to activate the radio and S1 bearers for all the active\n    EPS Bearers by the TAU procedure when the UE is in ECM-IDLE state.\n    Signalling active flag is a request by UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation to maintain the NAS signalling connection after Tracking\n    Area Update Procedure is completed in order to transmit pending Data\n    using the Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation or NAS\n    signalling. The EPS bearer status indicates each EPS bearer that is\n    active in the UE. The TAU Request message shall be integrity protected\n    by the NAS-MAC as described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41]. eKSI, NAS sequence\n    number and NAS-MAC are included if the UE has valid EPS security\n    parameters. NAS sequence number indicates the sequential number of the\n    NAS message. KSI is included if the UE indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-\n    TMSI in the information element \"old GUTI\".\n\n     In the RRC connection establishment signalling associated with the TAU\n    Request, the UE indicates its support of the CIoT EPS Optimisations\n    relevant for MME selection.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no active flag or EPS bearer status included in\n    the TAU Request message. For a UE with a running Service Gap timer in\n    the UE the UE shall not set the active flag and the signalling active\n    flag in the TAU request message (see clause\u00a04.3.17.9).\n\n     If the UE has any PDN connection of PDN Type \"non-IP\" or \"Ethernet\",\n    the UE shall send the EPS bearer status in the TAU Request message.\n\n     The UE sets the voice domain preference and UE's usage setting\n    according to its configuration, as described in clause\u00a04.3.5.9.\n\n     The UE includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information element\n    if it needs to enable extended idle mode DRX, even if extended idle\n    mode DRX parameters were already negotiated before.\n\n     If a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the\n    Network Behaviour the UE is expecting to be available in the network as\n    defined in clause\u00a04.3.5.10.\n\n     If the UE supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a, and if the UE is\n    provisioned with a UE Radio Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN\n    (i.e.PLMN-assigned for the specific PLMN or manufacturer-assigned), the\n    UE includes a flag that indicates it has an assigned UE Radio\n    Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN but the actual UE Radio\n    Capability is provided to MME after security context is established in\n    step\u00a06 (see below).\n\n  3. The eNodeB derives the MME address from the RRC parameters carrying\n    the old GUMMEI, the indicated Selected Network and the RAT (NB-IoT or\n    WB-E-UTRAN). If that MME is not associated with that eNodeB or the\n    GUMMEI is not available or the UE indicates that the TAU procedure was\n    triggered by load re-balancing, the eNodeB selects an MME as described\n    in clause 4.3.8.3 on \"MME Selection Function\".\n\n     The eNodeB forwards the TAU Request message together with the CSG\n    access mode, CSG ID, TAI+ECGI of the cell from where it received the\n    message and with the Selected Network to the new MME. CSG ID is\n    provided by RAN if the UE sends the TAU Request message via a CSG cell\n    or a hybrid cell. CSG access mode is provided if the UE sends the TAU\n    Request message via a hybrid cell. If the CSG access mode is not\n    provided but the CSG ID is provided, the MME shall consider the cell as\n    a CSG cell. For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW\n    architecture the eNodeB includes the Local Home Network ID in the\n    Initial UE Message and in Uplink NAS Transport message if the target\n    cell is in a Local Home Network.\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB indicates the UE's Coverage Level\n    to the MME.\n\n  4. The new MME differentiates the type of the old node, i.e. MME or SGSN,\n    as specified in clause\u00a04.3.19, uses the GUTI received from the UE to\n    derive the old MME/S4 SGSN address, and sends a Context Request (old\n    GUTI, complete TAU Request message, P-TMSI Signature, MME Address, UE\n    validated, CIoT EPS Optimisation support inidication) message to the\n    old MME/old S4 SGSN to retrieve user information. UE Validated\n    indicates that the new MME has validated the integrity protection of\n    the TAU message, e.g. based on native EPS security context for the UE.\n    To validate the Context Request the old MME uses the complete TAU\n    Request message and the old S4 SGSN uses the P-TMSI Signature and\n    responds with an appropriate error if integrity check fails in old\n    MME/S4 SGSN. This shall initiate the security functions in the new MME.\n    If the security functions authenticate the UE correctly, the new MME\n    shall send a Context Request (IMSI, complete TAU Request message, MME\n    Address, UE Validated) message to the old MME/S4 SGSN with the UE\n    Validated set. If the new MME indicates that it has authenticated the\n    UE or if the old MME/old S4 SGSN correctly validates the UE, then the\n    old MME/old S4\u00a0SGSN starts a timer.\n\n     If the UE with emergency bearers is not authenticated in the old\n    MME/old S4 SGSN (in a network supporting unauthenticated UEs) the old\n    MME/old S4 SGSN continues the procedure with sending a Context Response\n    and starting the timer also when it cannot validate the Context\n    Request.\n\n     If a RLOS attached UE is not successfully authenticated in the old\n    MME, the old MME continues the procedure with sending a Context\n    Response and starting the existing timer also when it cannot validate\n    the Context Request.\n\n     If the new MME supports CIoT EPS Optimisation, CIoT EPS Optimisation\n    support indication is included in the Context Request indicating\n    support for various CIoT EPS Optimisations (e.g. support for header\n    compression for CP CIoT EPS Optimisation, etc.).\n\n  5. If the Context Request is sent to an old MME the old MME responds with\n    a Context Response (IMSI, ME Identity (IMEISV), MM Context, EPS Bearer\n    Context(s), Serving GW signalling Address and TEID(s), ISR Supported,\n    MS Info Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information\n    Reporting Action (if available), UE Time Zone, UE Core Network\n    Capability, UE Specific DRX Parameters, Remaining Running Service Gap\n    timer, LTE-M UE Indication) message. If the new MME supports CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation and the use of header compression has been negotiated\n    between the UE and the old MME, the Context Response also includes the\n    Header Compression Configuration which includes the information\n    necessary for the ROHC channel setup but not the RoHC context itself.\n\n     If the Context Request is sent to an old S4\u00a0SGSN the old S4\u00a0SGSN\n    responds with a Context Response (MM Context, EPS Bearer Context(s),\n    Serving GW signalling Address and TEID(s), ISR Supported, MS Info\n    Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information Reporting\n    Action (if available), UE Time Zone, UE Core Network Capability, UE\n    Specific DRX Parameters). If the source MME has not yet reported a non-\n    zero MO Exception Data Counter to the PDN GW, the Context Response also\n    includes the MO Exception Data Counter as described in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43].\n\n     The MM Context contains security related information as well as other\n    parameters (including IMSI and ME Identity (if available)) as described\n    in clause\u00a05.7.2 (Information Storage for MME). The unused\n    Authentication Quintets in the MM Context are also maintained in the\n    SGSN. TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41] gives further details on the transfer of security\n    related information.\n\n     If the MM Context received with the Context Response message did not\n    include IMEISV and the MME does not already store the IMEISV of the UE,\n    the MME shall retrieve the ME Identity (IMEISV) from the UE.\n\n     The PDN GW Address and TEID(s) (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE Keys (PMIP-\n    based S5/S8 at the PDN GW(s) for uplink traffic) and the TI(s), is part\n    of the EPS Bearer Context. If the UE is not known in the old MME/old\n    S4\u00a0SGSN or if the integrity check for the TAU Request message fails,\n    the old MME/old S4\u00a0SGSN responds with an appropriate error cause. ISR\n    Supported is indicated if the old MME/old S4 SGSN and associated\n    Serving GW are capable to activate ISR for the UE.\n\n     If the UE receives emergency bearer services from the old MME/old S4\n    SGSN and the UE is UICCless, IMSI can not be included in the Context\n    Response. For emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be\n    authenticated, then the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also,\n    in this case, security parameters are included only if available.\n\n     For a RLOS attached UE, the old MME includes an RLOS indication to the\n    new MME. If the RLOS attached UE in the old MME does not have a USIM,\n    IMSI can not be included in the Context Response. If the RLOS attached\n    UE has USIM but the IMSI cannot be successfully authenticated, then the\n    IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also, in this case, security\n    parameters are included only if available.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW, the old MME/old S4 SGSN shall include\n    the Local Home Network ID of the old cell in the EPS Bearer context\n    corresponding to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS Bearer Context(s) included in the Context\n    Response message.\n\n     Based on the CIoT EPS Optimisation support indication, old MME only\n    transfers the EPS Bearer Context(s) that the new MME supports. If the\n    new MME does not support CIoT EPS Optimisation, EPS Bearer Context(s)\n    of non-IP PDN connection are not transferred to the new MME. If the new\n    MME does not support Ethernet PDN Type, EPS Bearer Context(s) of\n    Ethernet PDN type are not transferred to the new MME. If the EPS Bearer\n    Context(s) of a PDN connection has not been transferred, the old MME\n    shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed and release\n    that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN disconnection\n    procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3. The buffered data in the old MME\n    is discarded after receipt of Context Acknowledgement.\n\n     If the EPS Bearer Context(s) are to be transferred to the new MME, the\n    old MME also includes the Serving GW IP address and TEID for both S1-U\n    and S11-U, if available.\n\n     If the Old MME is aware the UE is a LTE-M UE, it provides the LTE-M UE\n    Indication to the new MME.\n\n  6. If the integrity check of TAU Request message (sent in step\u00a02) failed,\n    then authentication is mandatory. The authentication functions are\n    defined in clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\". Ciphering procedures\n    are described in clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\". If GUTI\n    allocation is going to be done and the network supports ciphering, the\n    NAS messages shall be ciphered.\n\n     If this TAU request is received for a UE which is already in\n    ECM_CONNECTED state and the PLMN-ID of the TAI sent by the eNodeB in\n    Step\u00a03 is different from that of the GUTI, included in the TAU Request\n    message, the MME shall delay authenticating the UE until after Step\u00a021\n    (TAU Complete message).\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The MME delays the authentication such that the UE first updates\n         its registered PLMN-ID to the new PLMN-ID selected by the RAN\n         during handover. The new PLMN-ID is provided by the MME to the UE\n         as part of the GUTI in the TAU accept message in Step\u00a020. Doing\n         this ensures that the same PLMN-ID is used in the derivation of the\n         Kasme key by both the network and the UE.\n\n     If the new MME is configured to allow emergency bearer services for\n    unauthenticated UE the new MME behave as follows:\n\n    -  where a UE has only emergency bearer services, the MME either skip\n       the authentication and security procedure or accepts that the\n       authentication may fail and continues the Tracking Area Update\n       procedure; or\n\n    -  where a UE has both emergency and non emergency bearer services and\n       authentication fails, the MME continues the Tracking Area Update\n       procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDN connections as\n       specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n     If the new MME is configured to allow Restricted Local Operator\n    Services, the new MME, based on local regulation and operator policy,\n    may skip the authentication and security procedure, or may perform\n    authentication if security parameters are available, or obtainable from\n    HSS, and continues the Tracking Area Update procedure regardless of the\n    authentication result.\n\n     If the UE indicated it has a UE Radio Capability ID assigned for use\n    in the selected PLMN in step\u00a02, the MME may request the UE to provide\n    the UE Radio Capability ID in Security Mode Command, if the MME needs\n    to get the UE Radio Capability ID from the UE e.g. at inter-PLMN\n    mobility. If enquired by the MME the UE shall include the UE Radio\n    Capability ID in Security Mode Command Accept for the supported UE\n    radio capabilities.\n\n  7. The MME (if the MME has changed then it is the new MME) determines to\n    relocate the Serving GW. The Serving GW is relocated when the old\n    Serving GW cannot continue to serve the UE. The MME (if the MME has\n    changed then it is the new MME) may also decide to relocate the Serving\n    GW if a new Serving GW is expected to serve the UE longer and/or with a\n    more optimal UE to PDN GW path, or if a new Serving GW can be co-\n    located with the PDN GW. Selection of a new Serving GW is performed\n    according to clause\u00a04.3.8.2 on \"Serving GW selection function\".\n\n     If the MME has changed the new MME sends a Context Acknowledge\n    (Serving GW change indication) message to the old MME/old S4 SGSN.\n    Serving GW change indication indicates a new Serving GW has been\n    selected. The old MME/old S4 SGSN marks in its UE context that the\n    information in the GWs is invalid. And, if the old node is an MME, the\n    old MME marks in its UE context that the information in the HSS is\n    invalid. This ensures that the old MME/old S4 SGSN updates the GWs, and\n    the old MME updates the HSS, if the UE initiates a TAU or RAU procedure\n    back to the old MME/old S4 SGSN before completing the ongoing TAU\n    procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  Updating the GWs refers to deletion of session(s) on the Serving\n         GW followed by re-creation of session(s) on the Serving GW. The re-\n         creation of session(s) on the Serving GW will result in successful\n         re-establishment of the S5/S8 tunnel between the selected Serving\n         GW and the PDN GW.\n\n     If the security functions do not authenticate the UE correctly, then\n    the TAU shall be rejected, and the new MME shall send a reject\n    indication to the old MME/old S4 SGSN. The old MME/old S4 SGSN shall\n    continue as if the Identification and Context Request was never\n    received.\n\n     ISR is not indicated in the Context Acknowledge as ISR is not\n    activated due to the S-GW change.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, the steps 8, 9, 10, 11, 18 and 19 are skipped.\n\n  8. If the MME has changed the new MME verifies the EPS bearer status\n    received from the UE with the bearer contexts received from the old\n    MME/old S4 SGSN. If the MME has not changed the MME verifies EPS bearer\n    status from the UE with the bearer contexts available in the MM\n    context. The MME releases any network resources related to EPS bearers\n    that are not active in the UE. If there is no bearer context at all,\n    the MME rejects the TAU Request.\n\n     If the MME selected a new Serving GW it sends a Create Session Request\n    (IMSI, bearer contexts, MME Address and TEID, Type, the Protocol Type\n    over S5/S8, RAT type, LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag, Serving\n    Network, UE Time Zone, MO Exception data counter) message per PDN\n    connection to the selected new Serving GW. The PDN GW address and TFT\n    (for PMIP-based S5/S8) are indicated in the bearer Contexts. Type\n    indicates to the Serving GW to send the Modify Bearer Request to the\n    PDN GW. The Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which\n    protocol should be used over S5/S8 interface. RAT type indicates a\n    change in radio access. If it is a mobility from a SGSN to a MME and if\n    the MME supports location information change reporting, the MME shall\n    include the User Location Information (according to the supported\n    granularity) in the Create Session Request, regardless of whether\n    location information change reporting had been requested in the\n    previous RAT by the PDN GW. If it is an inter MME mobility and if the\n    PDN GW requested location information change reporting, the MME\n    includes the User Location Information IE in this message if it is\n    different compared to the previously sent information. If the PDN GW\n    requested User CSG information, the MME also includes the User CSG\n    Information IE in this message. If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\n    applies, the MME may also indicate S11-U tunnelling of NAS user data\n    and send its own S11-U IP address and MME DL TEID for DL data\n    forwarding by the SGW. The MME shall include the MO Exception data\n    counter if it has received the counter for RRC cause \"MO Exception\n    data\" in the Context Response message.\n\n     If only the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation is used, the MME shall\n    include a Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indicator in Create Session\n    Request.\n\n     If the new MME receives the EPS bearer context with SCEF, then the new\n    MME updates the SCEF as defined in TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74].\n\n     If the UE is using the LTE-M RAT type and the PDN GW expects the LTE-M\n    RAT type reporting as specified in clause\u00a05.11.5, the MME also includes\n    the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag to indicate to the Serving GW\n    to forward the LTE-M RAT type to the PDN GW.\n\n  9. The Serving GW informs the PDN\u00a0GW(s) about the change of for example\n    the RAT type that e.g. can be used for charging, by sending the message\n    Modify Bearer Request (Serving GW Address and TEID, RAT type, Serving\n    Network, PDN Charging Pause Support Indication) per PDN connection to\n    the PDN\u00a0GW(s) concerned. User Location Information IE and/or UE Time\n    Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE and/or MO Exception data counter\n    are also included if they are present in step\u00a08. The Serving GW and PDN\n    GW indicate each use of the RRC establishment cause \"MO Exception Data\"\n    by the related counter on its CDR.\n\n     If the Serving GW has received the Control Plane Only PDN Connection\n    Indicator in step\u00a08, the Serving GW indicates the use of CP only on its\n    CDR.\n\n     If LTE-M RAT type and the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag were\n    received at step\u00a08, the Serving GW shall include the LTE-M RAT type in\n    the Modify Bearer Request message to the PGW. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    includes RAT type WB-E-UTRAN.\n\n  9a If dynamic PCC is deployed, and RAT type information needs to be\n    conveyed from the PDN\u00a0GW to the PCRF, then the PDN\u00a0GW shall send RAT\n    type information to the PCRF by means of an IP-CAN Session Modification\n    procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The PDN\u00a0GW does not need to wait for the PCRF response, but\n         continues in the next step. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS\n         bearer modification the PDN\u00a0GW should initiate a bearer update\n         procedure.\n\n  10.  The PDN GW updates its bearer contexts and returns a Modify Bearer\n    Response (MSISDN, Charging Id, PDN Charging Pause Enabled Indication\n    (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the function)) message. The MSISDN is\n    included if the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. If there has\n    been a RAT change towards E-UTRAN and location information change\n    reporting is required and supported in the target MME, the PDN\u00a0GW shall\n    provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer Response.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path in\n    order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. If the\n    Serving GW has no downlink user plane established, the Serving GW shall\n    discard the \"end marker\" received from the PDN GW and shall not send\n    Downlink Data Notification. Otherwise the Serving GW shall forward the\n    \"end marker\" packets to the source eNodeB or source S4 SGSN.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW updates its bearer context. This allows the Serving\n    GW to route bearer PDUs to the PDN GW when received from eNodeB.\n\n     The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response (Serving GW address\n    and TEID for user plane and control plane and PDN\u00a0GW TEIDs (for GTP-\n    based S5/S8) or GRE keys (for PMIP-based S5/S8) for uplink traffic and\n    control plane, MS Info Change Reporting Action) message to the new MME.\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies and if the MME does not\n    include Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indicator in the Create\n    Session Request:\n\n    -  If separation of S11-U from S1-U is required, the Serving GW shall\n       include the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U and additionally\n       the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S1-U in the Create Session\n       Response.\n\n    -  Otherwise, if separation of S11-U from S1-U is not required, the\n       Serving GW includes the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U in\n       Create Session Response.\n\n     When the MME receives the Create Session Response message, the MME\n    checks if there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event\n    or a \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the\n    MME and in such a case sends an event notification (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]\n    for further information).\n\n  12.  The new MME verifies whether it holds subscription data for the UE\n    identified by the GUTI, the additional GUTI or by the IMSI received\n    with the context data from the old CN node.\n\n     If there are no subscription data in the new MME for this UE, or for\n    some network sharing scenario (e.g. GWCN) if the PLMN-ID of the TAI\n    supplied by the eNodeB is different from that of the GUTI in the UE's\n    context, then the new MME sends an Update Location Request (MME\n    Identity, IMSI, ULR-Flags, MME Capabilities, Homogeneous Support of IMS\n    Voice over PS Sessions, UE SRVCC capability, equivalent PLMN list, ME\n    Identity (IMEISV)) message to the HSS. ULR-Flags indicates that update\n    location is sent from an MME and the MME registration shall be updated\n    in HSS. The HSS does not cancel any SGSN registration. The MME\n    capabilities indicate the MME's support for regional access\n    restrictions functionality. The inclusion of the equivalent PLMN list\n    indicates that the MME supports the inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell\n    in an equivalent PLMN using the subscription information of the target\n    PLMN. The \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication\n    (see clause\u00a04.3.5.8A) shall not be included unless the MME has\n    completed its evaluation of the support of \"IMS Voice over PS Session\"\n    as specified in clause\u00a04.3.5.8. The ME Identity is included if step\u00a05\n    caused the MME to retrieve the IMEISV from the UE.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  At this step, the MME may not have all the information needed to\n         determine the setting of the IMS Voice over PS Session Supported\n         indication for this UE (see clause\u00a04.3.5.8). Hence the MME can send\n         the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" later on in\n         this procedure.\n\n     If the UE initiates the TAU procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous\n    CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the\n    VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and the MME needs to retrieve the\n    CSG subscription information of the UE from the CSS, the MME initiates\n    the Update CSG Location Procedure with CSS as described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.12.\n\n     If the MME determines that only the UE SRVCC capability has changed,\n    the MME sends a Notify Request to the HSS to inform about the changed\n    UE SRVCC capability.\n\n     If all the EPS bearers of the UE have emergency ARP value, the new MME\n    may skip the update location procedure or proceed even if the update\n    location fails.\n\n     If the UE is RLOS attached, the new MME skips the Update Location\n    procedure.\n\n  13.  The HSS sends the message Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type)\n    to the old MME with Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure.\n\n  14.  If the timer started in step 4 is not running, the old MME removes\n    the MM context. Otherwise, the contexts are removed when the timer\n    expires. It also ensures that the MM context is kept in the old MME for\n    the case the UE initiates another TAU procedure before completing the\n    ongoing TAU procedure to the new MME. The old MME acknowledges with the\n    message Cancel Location Ack (IMSI).\n\n  15.  When old S4 SGSN receives the Context Acknowledge message and if the\n    UE is in Iu Connected, the old S4\u00a0SGSN sends an Iu Release Command\n    message to the RNC after the timer started in step\u00a04 has expired.\n\n  16.  The RNC responds with an Iu Release Complete message.\n\n  17.  The HSS acknowledges the Update Location Request message by sending\n    an Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription Data) message to the new\n    MME. The Subscription Data may contain the CSG subscription data for\n    the registered PLMN and for the equivalent PLMN list requested by MME\n    in step\u00a012.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Enhanced Coverage Restricted\n    parameter. If received from the HSS, MME stores this Enhanced Coverage\n    Restricted parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     The subscription data may contain a Service Gap Time. If received from\n    the HSS, the MME stores this Service Gap Time in the MME MM context for\n    the UE and passes it to the UE in the Tracking Area Update Accept\n    message.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter that applies to the UEs on a specific RAT, e.g. NB-IoT. If\n    received from the HSS, MME stores this Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     If the Update Location is rejected by the HSS, the new MME rejects the\n    TAU Request from the UE with an appropriate cause. In such cases, the\n    new MME releases any local MME EPS Bearer contexts for this particular\n    UE, and additionally deletes the EPS bearer resources in the new\n    Serving GW by sending the Delete Session Request (Cause, Operation\n    Indication) messages to the new Serving GW. The Operation Indication\n    flag shall not be set. Therefore, the new Serving GW receiving this\n    request shall not initiate a delete procedure towards the PDN GW.\n\n     If the UE initiates the TAU procedure at a CSG cell, the new MME shall\n    check whether the CSG ID and associated PLMN is contained in the CSG\n    subscription and is not expired. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN is\n    not present or expired, the MME shall send a Tracking Area Update\n    reject message to the UE with an appropriate cause value. The UE shall\n    remove the CSG ID and associated PLMN from its Allowed CSG list if\n    present. If the UE has ongoing emergency bearer services no CSG access\n    control shall be performed.\n\n     If all checks are successful then the new MME constructs a context for\n    the UE.\n\n  18.  If the MME has changed, when the timer started in step\u00a04 expires the\n    old MME/old S4 SGSN releases any local MME or SGSN bearer resources and\n    additionally the old MME/old S4 SGSN deletes the EPS bearer resources\n    by sending the Delete Session Request (Cause, Operation Indication)\n    messagesto the old Serving GW if it received the Serving GW change\n    indication in the Context Acknowledge message in step\u00a07. When the\n    Operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to the old Serving\n    GW that the old Serving GW shall not initiate a delete procedure\n    towards the PDN GW. If ISR is activated the Cause indicates to the old\n    S-GW that the old S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on the other\n    old CN node by sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN\n    node.\n\n     If the MME has not changed, step 11 triggers the release of the EPS\n    bearer resources at the old Serving GW.\n\n  19.  The Serving GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause)\n    messages. The Serving GW discards any packets buffered for the UE.\n\n  20.  If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions\n    (e.g. CSG restrictions) (received in update location procedure in\n    step\u00a017) the UE is not allowed to access the TA:\n\n    -  The MME rejects the Tracking Area Update Request with an appropriate\n       cause to the UE.\n\n    -  For UEs with emergency EPS bearers, i.e. at least one EPS bearer has\n       an ARP value reserved for emergency services, the new MME accepts the\n       Tracking Area Update Request and deactivates all non-emergency PDN\n       connections as specified in clause\u00a05.10.3. If the Tracking Area\n       Update procedure is initiated in ECM-IDLE state, all non-emergency\n       EPS bearers are deactivated by the Tracking Area Update procedure\n       without bearer deactivation signalling between the UE and the MME.\n\n     The MME sends a TAU Accept (GUTI, TAI list, EPS bearer status, NAS\n    sequence number, NAS-MAC, IMS Voice over PS session supported,\n    Emergency Service Support indicator, LCS Support Indication, Supported\n    Network Behaviour, Service Gap Time, Enhanced Coverage Restricted,\n    Indication of support of 15 EPS bearers per UE) message to the UE. If\n    the active flag is set the MME may provide the eNodeB with Handover\n    Restriction List. GUTI is included if the MME allocates a new GUTI. If\n    the active flag is set in the TAU Request message the user plane setup\n    procedure can be activated in conjunction with the TAU Accept message.\n    If the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time for the UE in the MME has not\n    expired, the user plane setup procedure is activated even if the MME\n    did not receive the active flag in the TAU Request message. If the new\n    MME receives the Downlink Data Notification message or any downlink\n    signalling message while the UE is still connected, the user plane\n    setup procedure may be activated even if the new MME did not receive\n    the active flag in the TAU Request message. The procedure is described\n    in detail in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. The message sequence should be the same as\n    for the UE triggered Service Request procedure specified in clause\n    5.3.4.1 from the step when MME establishes the bearer(s). The MME\n    indicates the EPS bearer status IE to the UE. The UE removes any\n    internal resources related to bearers that are not marked active in the\n    received EPS bearer status. If the EPS bearer status information was in\n    the TAU Request, the MME shall indicate the EPS bearer status to the\n    UE. Handover Restriction List is described in clause\u00a04.3.5.7 \"Mobility\n    Restrictions\". The MME sets the IMS Voice over PS session supported as\n    described in clause\u00a04.3.5.8.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS bearer status included in the TAU Accept\n    message.\n\n     The MME indicates the CIoT EPS Optimisations it supports and prefers\n    in the Supported Network Behaviour information as defined in\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.10.\n\n     If there is a Service Gap timer running for the UE in the MME, and the\n    active flag or the signalling active flag is received in the TAU\n    Request message, the MME shall ignore the active flag and signalling\n    active flag and not perform any of the actions related to these flags.\n\n     The MME shall include the Service Gap Time in the TAU Accept message\n    if the UE has indicated Service Gap Control capability and either if\n    Service Gap Time was received in step\u00a017 from HSS in the subscription\n    information or if the Service Gap Time in the subscription information\n    has been updated by HSS User Profile management (i.e. the Insert\n    Subscriber Data procedure in clause\u00a05.3.9.2).\n\n     If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage\n    in step\u00a01, the MME sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the\n    eNB in the S1-AP message as defined in clause\u00a04.3.28. The MME also\n    sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the UE in the TAU\n    Accept message. UE shall store Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter\n    and shall use the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to\n    determine if enhanced coverage feature should be used or not.\n\n     If the MME successfully obtained Header Compression Configuration\n    parameters in step\u00a05 it indicates the continued use of previous\n    negotiated configuration to the UE in the Header Compression Context\n    Status for each EPS Bearer of the UE. When Header Compression Context\n    Status indicates that the previous negotiated configuration can no\n    longer be used for some EPS bearers, the UE shall stop performing\n    header compression and decompression, when sending or receiving data\n    using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation on these EPS bearers.\n\n     If the MME did not receive the Voice Support Match Indicator in the MM\n    Context, then the MME may send a UE Radio Capability Match Request to\n    the eNB as described in clause\u00a05.3.14. If the MME hasn't received Voice\n    Support Match Indicator from the eNB then, based on implementation, MME\n    may set IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication and update it at\n    a later stage. After step\u00a012, and in parallel to any of the preceding\n    steps, the MME shall send a Notify Request (Homogeneous Support of IMS\n    Voice over PS Sessions) message to the HSS:\n\n    -  If the MME has evaluated the support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions,\n       see clause\u00a04.3.5.8, and\n\n    -  If the MME determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous\n       Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause\u00a04.3.5.8A.\n\n     The Emergency Service Support indicator informs the UE that Emergency\n    bearer services are supported. LCS Support Indication indicates whether\n    the network supports the EPC-MO-LR and/or CS-MO-LR as described in\n    TS\u00a023.271\u00a0[57]. Indication for support of 15 EPS bearers per UE\n    indicates the network support for up to 15 EPS bearers per UE as\n    defined in clause\u00a04.12.\n\n     If the UE included extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element, the MME includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element if it decides to enable extended idle mode DRX with Paging Time\n    Window length assigned considering Subscribed Paging Time Window (if\n    available) and the local policy.\n\n     When receiving the TAU Accept message and there is no ISR Activated\n    indication the UE shall set its TIN to \"GUTI\".\n\n     For a S-GW change, ISR Activated is never indicated by the MME as it\n    needs a RAU with the same S-GW first to activate ISR. For an MME\n    change, ISR is not activated by the new MME to avoid context transfer\n    procedures with two old CN nodes.\n\n     If the TAU procedure is initiated by manual CSG selection and occurs\n    via a CSG cell, the UE upon receiving the TAU Accept message shall add\n    the CSG ID and associated PLMN to its Allowed CSG list if it is not\n    already present. Manual CSG selection is not supported if the UE has\n    emergency bearers established.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed in conjunction with the TAU\n    Accept message and the TAU is performed via a hybrid cell, then the MME\n    shall send an indication whether the UE is a CSG member to the RAN\n    along with the S1-MME control message. Based on this information the\n    RAN may perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG members.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  If the UE receives a TAU Accept message via a hybrid cell, the\n         UE does not add the corresponding CSG ID and associated PLMN to its\n         Allowed CSG list. Adding a CSG ID and associated PLMN to the UE's\n         local Allowed CSG list for a hybrid cell is performed only by OTA\n         or OMA DM procedures.\n\n     If the UE receives a Service Gap Time in the TAU Accept message, the\n    UE shall store this parameter and apply Service Gap Control (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.17.9).\n\n     If the UE has indicated support for dual connectivity with NR in the\n    TAU Request and the UE is not allowed to use NR as Secondary RAT, the\n    MME indicates that to the UE in the TAU Accept message.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed and if RACS is supported and MME\n    has UE Radio Capability ID in UE context, it signals the UE Radio\n    Capability ID to the eNB as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a. If the eNB does\n    not have mapping between the specific UE Radio Capability ID and the UE\n    radio capabilities, it shall use the procedure described in\n    TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36] to retrieve the mapping from the Core Network.\n\n  21.  If GUTI was included in the TAU Accept, the UE acknowledges the\n    received message by returning a TAU Complete message to the MME.\n\n     When the \"Active flag\" is not set in the TAU Request message and the\n    Tracking Area Update was not initiated in ECM-CONNECTED state, the new\n    MME releases the signalling connection with UE, according to\n    clause\u00a05.3.5. For a UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, when\n    the \"Signalling active flag\" is set, the new MME shall not release the\n    NAS signalling connection with the UE immediately after the TAU\n    procedure is completed.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  The new MME may initiate E-RAB establishment (see\n         TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]) after execution of the security functions, or wait\n         until completion of the TA update procedure. For the UE, E-RAB\n         establishment may occur anytime after the TA update request is\n         sent.\n\nIn the case of a rejected tracking area update operation, due to regional\nsubscription, roaming restrictions or access restrictions (see\nTS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27] and TS\u00a023.008\u00a0[28]) the new MME should not construct an MM\ncontext for the UE. In the case of receiving the subscriber data from HSS,\nthe new MME may construct an MM context and store the subscriber data for\nthe UE to optimise signalling between the MME and the HSS. A reject shall\nbe returned to the UE with an appropriate cause and the S1 connection shall\nbe released. Upon return to idle, the UE shall act according to\nTS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\nThe new MME shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on the\nreceived APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Context Response\nmessage and then store the new Maximum APN restriction value.\n\nThe bearer contexts shall be prioritized by the new MME. If the new MME is\nunable to support the same number of active bearer contexts as received\nfrom old MME/SGSN, the prioritisation is used to decide which bearer\ncontexts to maintain active and which ones to delete. In any case, the new\nMME shall first update all contexts in one or more P-GWs and then\ndeactivate the bearer context(s) that it cannot maintain as described in\nthe clause \"MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation Procedure\". This\nshall not cause the MME to reject the tracking area update.\n\nThe new MME shall not deactivate emergency service related EPS bearers,\ni.e. EPS bearers with ARP value reserved for emergency services.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  If MS (UE) was in PMM-CONNECTED state the bearer contexts are\n         sent already in the Forward Relocation Request message as described\n         in the clause \"Serving RNS relocation procedures\" of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\nIf the tracking area update procedure fails a maximum allowable number of\ntimes, or if the MME returns a Tracking Area Update Reject (Cause) message,\nthe UE shall enter EMM DEREGISTERED state.\n\nIf the new MME identifies that the RAT type has changed, the MME checks the\nsubscription information to identify for each APN whether to maintain the\nPDN connection, disconnect the PDN connection with a reactivation request,\nor, disconnect the PDN connection without reactivation request.

The timer setting by the old S4 SGSN or MME in step\u00a04 (as in\n    clause\u00a05.3.3.1) shall ensure that the buffered data in the old Serving\n    GW can be forwarded before the old Serving GW resource is released.\n\n  5. DL data is being buffered in the old Serving GW and the DL Data\n    Expiration Time has not expired, therefore the old MME/old S4-SGSN\n    indicates Buffered DL Data Waiting in the Context Response. This\n    triggers the new MME to setup the user plane and invoke data\n    forwarding. For Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, if the DL data is\n    buffered in the old Serving GW, and when the Buffered DL Data Waiting\n    is indicated, the new MME shall setup the S11 user plane with the new\n    Serving GW and invoke data forwarding. If the DL data is buffered in\n    the old MME and the DL Data Expiration Time has not expired, the old\n    MME shall discard the buffered DL data.\n\n  11-12. The user plane is setup.

Since it was indicated in step\u00a05 that buffered DL data is waiting,\n    the new MME sets up forwarding parameters by sending Create Indirect\n    Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (target eNodeB addresses and TEIDs for\n    forwarding) to the Serving GW. The Serving GW sends a Create Indirect\n    Data Forwarding Tunnel Response (target Serving GW addresses and TEIDs\n    for forwarding) to the target MME. For Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation, the new MME sets up forwarding parameters by sending\n    Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (target MME address and\n    TEID for forwarding) to the Serving GW. Upon receipt of the Create\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response message the new MME starts a\n    timer for release of resources if resources for indirect forwarding\n    were allocated in the new S-GW.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  14.  This procedure step\u00a0is defined in clause\u00a05.3.3.1, step\u00a07. In\n    addition the new MME includes the F-TEID where buffered DL data should\n    be forwarded and a Forwarding indication in the Context Acknowledge\n    message. The F-TEID is the F-TEID for the indirect forwarding received\n    from step\u00a013 or it may be the F-TEID of the eNB (when eNB supports\n    forwarding).\n\n  15.  A Modify Bearer Request( F-TEID ) is sent to the old Serving GW. The\n    F-TEID is the Forwarding F-TEID where the buffered DL data shall be\n    forwarded.\n\n  16.  The old Serving GW forwards its buffered data towards the received F-\n    TEID in step\u00a015. The buffered DL data is sent to the UE over the radio\n    bearers established in step\u00a011. For Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation, the buffered DL data is sent to the new MME from the new\n    Serving GW and is sent to the UE as described in steps 12-14 of\n    clause\u00a05.3.4B.3.\n\n  17-18. As steps 15-16, 18-19 in clause\u00a05.3.3.1.\n\n  19.  If indirect forwarding was used, then the expiry of the timer at the\n    new MME started at step\u00a013 triggers the new MME to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the new S-GW to\n    release temporary resources used for indirect forwarding that were\n    allocated at step\u00a013.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without S-GW Change", "numbering": "5.3.3.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.3.2  E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without S-GW Change\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n     Figure 5.3.3.2-1: E-UTRAN Tracking Area Update without S-GW change\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].

One of the triggers described in clause\u00a05.3.3.0 for starting the TAU\n    procedure occurs.\n\n  2. The UE initiates a TAU procedure by sending, to the eNodeB, a Tracking\n    Area Update Request (UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability,\n    Preferred Network behaviour, Support for restriction of use of Enhanced\n    Coverage, active flag, signalling active flag, EPS bearer status, old\n    GUTI, Old GUTI Type, last visited TAI, P-TMSI signature, additional\n    GUTI, KSISGSN, KSIASME, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, Voice domain\n    preference and UE's usage setting, UE has UE Radio Capability ID\n    assigned for the selected PLMN) message together with RRC parameters\n    indicating the Selected Network and the old GUMMEI. An exception is\n    that, if the TAU was triggered for load re-balancing purposes (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.7.3), the old GUMMEI is not included in the RRC parameters.\n    The UE shall set the Old GUTI Type to indicate whether the Old GUTI is\n    a native GUTI or is mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.\n\n     If the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" and the UE\n    holds a valid GUTI then the old GUTI indicates this valid GUTI. If the\n    UE's TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and related\n    RAI then these two elements are indicated as the old GUTI. Mapping a P-\n    TMSI and RAI to a GUTI is specified in Annex\u00a0H. When the UE is in\n    connected mode (e.g. in URA_PCH) when it reselects to E-UTRAN, the UE\n    shall set its TIN to \"P-TMSI\".\n\n     If the UE holds a valid GUTI and the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped\n    from a P-TMSI and RAI, then the UE indicates the GUTI as additional\n    GUTI. If the old GUTI indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI,\n    and the UE has a valid P-TMSI signature, the P-TMSI signature shall be\n    included.\n\n     The additional GUTI in the Tracking Area Update Request message allows\n    the new MME to find any already existing UE context stored in the new\n    MME when the old GUTI indicates a value mapped from a P-TMSI and RAI.\n\n     Alternatively, when a UE only supports E-UTRAN, it identifies itself\n    with the old GUTI and sets the Old GUTI Type to 'native'.\n\n     The RRC parameter \"old GUMMEI\" takes its value from the identifier\n    that is signalled as the old GUTI according to the rules above. For a\n    combined MME/SGSN the eNodeB is configured to route the MME-code(s) of\n    this combined node to the same combined node. This eNodeB is also\n    configured to route MME-code(s) of GUTIs that are generated the UE's\n    mapping of the P-TMSIs allocated by the combined node. Such an eNodeB\n    configuration may also be used for separate nodes to avoid changing\n    nodes in the pool caused by inter RAT mobility.\n\n     The last visited TAI shall be included in order to help the MME\n    produce a good list of TAIs for any subsequent TAU Accept message.\n    Selected Network indicates the network that is selected. Active flag is\n    a request by the UE to activate the radio and S1 bearers for all the\n    active EPS Bearers by the TAU procedure. Signalling active flag is a\n    request by UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation to maintain the\n    NAS signalling connection after Tracking Area Update Procedure is\n    completed in order to transmit pending Data using the Data Transport in\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation or NAS signalling. The UE's ISR\n    capability is included in the UE Core Network Capability element. The\n    EPS bearer status indicates each EPS bearer that is active in the UE.\n    The TAU Request message shall be integrity protected by the NAS-MAC as\n    described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41]. KSIASME is included if the UE has valid\n    security parameters. NAS sequence number indicates the sequential\n    number of the NAS message.\n\n     In the RRC connection establishment signalling associated with the TAU\n    Request, the UE indicates its support of the CIoT EPS Optimisations\n    relevant for MME selection.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no active flag or EPS bearer status included in\n    the TAU Request message. For a UE with a running Service Gap timer in\n    the UE the UE shall not set the active flag or the signalling active\n    flag in the TAU request message (see clause\u00a04.3.17.9).\n\n     If the UE has any PDN connection of PDN Type \"non-IP\" or \"Ethernet\",\n    the UE shall send the EPS bearer status in the TAU Request message.\n\n     KSISGSN is included if the UE indicates a GUTI mapped from a P-TMSI in\n    the information element \"old GUTI\".\n\n     The UE sets the voice domain preference and UE's usage setting\n    according to its configuration, as described in clause\u00a04.3.5.9.\n\n     The UE includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information element\n    if it needs to enable extended idle mode DRX, even if extended idle\n    mode DRX parameters were already negotiated before.\n\n     If a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the\n    Network Behaviour the UE is expecting to be available in the network as\n    defined in clause\u00a04.3.5.10.\n\n     If the UE supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a, and if the UE is\n    provisioned with a UE Radio Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN\n    (i.e.PLMN-assigned for the specific PLMN or manufacturer-assigned), the\n    UE includes a flag that indicates it has an assigned UE Radio\n    Capability ID for use in the selected PLMN but the actual UE Radio\n    Capability is provided to MME after security context is established in\n    step\u00a06 (see below).\n\n  3. The eNodeB derives the MME address from the RRC parameters carrying\n    the old GUMMEI, the indicated Selected Network and the RAT (NB-IoT or\n    WB-E-UTRAN). If that GUMMEI is not associated with the eNodeB, or the\n    GUMMEI is not available or the UE indicates that the TAU procedure was\n    triggered by load re-balancing, the eNodeB selects the MME as described\n    in clause 4.3.8.3 on \"MME Selection Function\". The eNodeB forwards the\n    TAU Request message together with the CSG access mode, CSG ID, TAI+ECGI\n    of the cell from where it received the message and with the Selected\n    Network to the MME. CSG ID is provided by RAN if the UE sends the TAU\n    Request message via a CSG cell or a hybrid cell. CSG access mode is\n    provided if the UE sends the TAU Request message via a hybrid cell. If\n    the CSG access mode is not provided but the CSG ID is provided, the MME\n    shall consider the cell as a CSG cell. For SIPTO at the Local Network\n    with stand-alone GW architecture the eNodeB includes the Local Home\n    Network ID in the Initial UE Message and in Uplink NAS Transport\n    message if the target cell is in a Local Home Network.\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB indicates the UE's Coverage Level\n    to the MME.\n\n  4. The new MME differentiates the type of the old node, i.e. MME or SGSN,\n    as specified in clause\u00a04.3.19, uses the GUTI received from the UE to\n    derive the old MME/S4 SGSN address and sends a Context Request (old\n    GUTI, MME Address, UE Validated, complete TAU Request message, P-TMSI\n    Signature, CIoT EPS Optimisation support inidication) message to the\n    old MME/S4\u00a0SGSN to retrieve the user information. UE Validated\n    indicates that the new MME has validated the integrity protection of\n    the TAU message, e.g. based on native EPS security context for the UE.\n    To validate the Context Request the old MME uses the complete TAU\n    Request message and the old S4 SGSN uses the P-TMSI Signature and\n    responds with an appropriate error if integrity check fails in old\n    MME/S4 SGSN. This shall initiate the security functions in the new MME.\n    If the security functions authenticate the UE correctly, the new MME\n    shall send a Context Request (IMSI, complete TAU Request message, MME\n    Address, UE Validated) message to the old MME/S4 SGSN with the UE\n    Validated set. If the new MME indicates that it has authenticated the\n    UE or if the old MME/old S4\u00a0SGSN authenticates the UE, the old MME/old\n    S4\u00a0SGSN starts a timer.\n\n     If the UE with emergency bearers is not authenticated in the old\n    MME/old S4 SGSN (in a network supporting unauthenticated UEs) the old\n    MME/old S4 SGSN continues the procedure with sending a Context Response\n    and starting the timer also when it cannot validate the Context\n    Request.\n\n     If a RLOS attached UE is not successfully authenticated in the old MME\n    and/or the Context Request cannot be validated, the old MME continues\n    the procedure with sending a Context Response and starting the existing\n    timer.\n\n     If the new MME supports CIoT EPS Optimisation, CIoT EPS Optimisation\n    support indication is included in the Context Request indicating\n    support for various CIoT EPS Optimisations (e.g. support for header\n    compression for CP CIoT EPS Optimisation, etc.).\n\n  5. If the Context Request is sent to an old MME the old MME responds with\n    a Context Response (IMSI, ME Identity (IMEISV), unused EPS\n    Authentication Vectors, KSIASME, KASME, EPS Bearer Context(s), Serving\n    GW signalling Address and TEID(s), MS Info Change Reporting Action (if\n    available), CSG Information Reporting Action (if available), UE Time\n    Zone, UE Core Network Capability, UE Specific DRX Parameters, Change to\n    Report (if present), Remaining Running Service Gap timer, LTE-M UE\n    Indication) message. If the new MME supports CIoT EPS Optimisation and\n    the use of header compression has been negotiated between the UE and\n    old MME, the Context Response also includes the Header Compression\n    Configuration which includes the information necessary for the ROHC\n    channel setup but not the RoHC context itself.\n\n     If the Context Request is sent to an old S4\u00a0SGSN the old S4 SGSN\n    responds with a Context Response (IMSI, ME Identity (if available),\n    unused Authentication Quintets, CK, IK, KSISGSN, EPS Bearer Context(s),\n    Serving GW signalling Address and TEID(s), ISR Supported, MS Info\n    Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information Reporting\n    Action (if available), UE Time Zone, UE Core Network Capability, UE\n    Specific DRX Parameters, Change to Report (if present)) message. The\n    Authentication Quintets are maintained by the old S4 SGSN.\n    TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41] gives further details on the transfer of security\n    related information.\n\n     Change to Report flag is included by the old MME or the old S4 SGSN if\n    reporting of change of UE Time Zone, or Serving Network, or both\n    towards Serving GW / PDN GW was deferred by the old MME or old S4 SGSN.\n\n     If the Context Response message did not include IMEISV and the MME\n    does not already store the IMEISV of the UE, the MME shall retrieve the\n    ME Identity (IMEISV) from the UE.\n\n     The PDN GW Address and TEID(s) (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE Keys (PMIP-\n    based S5/S8 at the PDN GW(s) for uplink traffic and the TI(s), is part\n    of the EPS Bearer Context. ISR Supported is indicated if the old SGSN\n    and associated Serving GW are capable to activate ISR for the UE.\n\n     The new MME shall ignore the UE Core Network Capability contained in\n    the Context Response only when it has previously received an UE Core\n    Network Capability in the Tracking Area Update Request. If the UE is\n    not known in the old MME/old S4\u00a0SGSN or if the integrity check for the\n    TAU request message fails, the old MME/old S4\u00a0SGSN responds with an\n    appropriate error cause.\n\n     If the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time for the UE has not expired (see\n    High latency communication in clause\u00a04.3.17.7), the old MME/old S4-SGSN\n    indicates Buffered DL Data Waiting in the Context Response. When this\n    is indicated, the new MME shall setup the user plane in conjunction to\n    the TAU procedure for delivery of the buffered DL data.\n\n     If the UE receives emergency bearer services from the old MME/old S4\n    SGSN and the UE is UICCless, IMSI can not be included in the Context\n    Response. For emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be\n    authenticated, then the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also,\n    in this case, security parameters are included only if available.\n\n     For a RLOS attached UE, the old MME includes an RLOS indication to the\n    new MME. If the RLOS attached UE in the old MME does not have a USIM,\n    IMSI can not be included in the Context Response. If the RLOS attached\n    UE has USIM but the IMSI cannot be successfully authenticated, then the\n    IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also, in this case, security\n    parameters are included only if available.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW, the old MME/old S4 SGSN shall include\n    the Local Home Network ID of the old cell in the EPS Bearer context\n    corresponding to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS Bearer Context(s) included in the Context\n    Response message.\n\n     Based on the CIoT EPS Optimisation support indication, old MME only\n    transfers the EPS Bearer Context(s) that the new MME supports. If the\n    new MME does not support CIoT EPS Optimisation, EPS Bearer Context(s)\n    of non-IP PDN connection are not transferred to the new MME. If the new\n    MME does not support Ethernet PDN Type, EPS Bearer Context(s) of\n    Ethernet PDN type are not transferred to the new MME. If the EPS Bearer\n    Context(s) of a PDN connection has not been transferred, the old MME\n    shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed and release\n    that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN disconnection\n    procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3. The buffered data in the old MME\n    is discarded after receipt of Context Acknowledgement.\n\n     If the EPS Bearer Context(s) are to be transferred to the new MME, the\n    old MME also includes the Serving GW IP address and TEID for both S1-U\n    and S11-U, if available.\n\n     If the Old MME is aware the UE is a LTE-M UE, it provides the LTE-M UE\n    Indication to the new MME.\n\n  6. If the integrity check of TAU Request message (sent in step\u00a02) failed,\n    then authentication is mandatory. The authentication functions are\n    defined in clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\". Ciphering procedures\n    are described in clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\". If GUTI\n    allocation is going to be done and the network supports ciphering, the\n    NAS messages shall be ciphered.\n\n     If this TAU request is received for a UE which is already in\n    ECM_CONNECTED state and the PLMN-ID of the TAI sent by the eNodeB in\n    Step\u00a03 is different from that of the GUTI included in the TAU Request\n    message, the MME shall delay authenticating the UE until after Step\u00a021\n    (TAU Complete message).\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The MME delays the authentication such that the UE first updates\n         its registered PLMN-ID to the new PLMN-ID selected by the RAN\n         during handover. The new PLMN-ID is provided by the MME to the UE\n         as part of the GUTI in the TAU accept message in Step\u00a020. Doing\n         this ensures that the same PLMN-ID is used in the derivation of the\n         Kasme key by both the network and the UE.\n\n     If the new MME is configured to allow emergency bearer services for\n    unauthenticated UE the new MME behave as follows:\n\n    -  where a UE has only emergency bearer services, the MME either skip\n       the authentication and security procedure or accepts that the\n       authentication may fail and continues the Tracking Area Update\n       procedure; or\n\n    -  where a UE has both emergency and non emergency bearer services and\n       authentication fails, the MME continues the Tracking Area Update\n       procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDN connections as\n       specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n     If the new MME is configured to support Restricted Local Operator\n    Services, the new MME, based on local regulation and operator policy,\n    may skip the authentication and security procedure, or may perform\n    authentication if security parameters are available or obtainable from\n    HSS and continues the Tracking Area Update procedure regardless of the\n    authentication result.\n\n     If the UE indicated it has a UE Radio Capability ID assigned for use\n    in the selected PLMN in step\u00a02, the MME may request the UE to provide\n    the UE Radio Capability ID in Security Mode Command, if the MME needs\n    to get the UE Radio Capability ID from the UE e.g. at inter-PLMN\n    mobility. If enquired by the MME the UE shall include the UE Radio\n    Capability ID in Security Mode Command Accept for the supported UE\n    radio capabilities.\n\n  7. If the old node is an old MME the new MME sends a Context Acknowledge\n    message to the old MME. The old MME marks in its context that the\n    information in the GW and the HSS are invalid. This ensures that the\n    MME updates the GWs and the HSS if the UE initiates a TAU procedure\n    back to the MME before completing the ongoing TAU procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  Updating the GWs refers to modification of session(s) on the\n         Serving GW. This will result in successful re-establishment of the\n         S11/S4 tunnel between the MME/SGSN and the Serving GW.\n\n     If the old node is an old S4\u00a0SGSN the MME sends a Context Acknowledge\n    (ISR Activated) message to the old SGSN. Unless ISR Activated is\n    indicated by the MME, the old S4\u00a0SGSN marks in its context that the\n    information in the GWs is invalid. This ensures that the old S4\u00a0SGSN\n    updates the GWs if the UE initiates a RAU procedure back to the old\n    S4\u00a0SGSN before completing the ongoing TAU procedure. If ISR Activated\n    is indicated to the old S4\u00a0SGSN, this indicates that the old S4\u00a0SGSN\n    shall maintain its UE context including authentication quintets and\n    stop the timer started in step\u00a04. In this case, if the Implicit Detach\n    timer is running, the old S4 SGSN shall re-start it with a slightly\n    larger value than the UE's GERAN/UTRAN Deactivate ISR timer. Also, in\n    this case, if the old SGSN has maintained the Serving GW address for\n    user plane and S4 GTP-U TEID, the old SGSN shall remove Serving GW\n    address for user plane and S4 GTP-U TEID locally. When ISR Activated is\n    not indicated and this timer expires the old SGSN deletes all bearer\n    resources of that UE. As the Context Acknowledge from the MME does not\n    include any S-GW change the S4\u00a0SGSN does not send any Delete Session\n    Request message to the S-GW. The MME shall not activate ISR if the\n    associated Serving GW does not support ISR.\n\n     If the security functions do not authenticate the UE correctly, then\n    the TAU shall be rejected, and the MME shall send a reject indication\n    to the old MME/old S4 SGSN. The old MME/old S4 SGSN shall continue as\n    if the Identification and Context Request was never received.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, the steps 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are skipped.\n\n  8. Void.\n\n  9. If the MME has changed the new MME adopts the bearer contexts received\n    from the old MME/SGSN as the UE's EPS bearer contexts to be maintained\n    by the new MME. The MME establishes the EPS bearer(s) in the indicated\n    order. The MME deactivates the EPS bearers which cannot be established.\n\n     The MME verifies the EPS bearer status received from the UE with the\n    EPS bearer contexts it maintains and releases any network resources\n    related to EPS bearers that are not active in the UE. If there is no\n    bearer context at all, the MME rejects the TAU Request. If the MME has\n    changed the new MME sends a Modify Bearer Request (new MME address and\n    TEID, ISR Activated, RAT type, LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag)\n    message per PDN connection to the Serving GW. If there is no need for\n    the SGW to send the signalling to the PDN GW, the MME may send Modify\n    Access Bearers Request (new MME address and TEID) per UE to the Serving\n    GW to optimise the signalling. The PDN GW address is indicated in the\n    bearer contexts. If indicated, the information ISR Activated indicates\n    that ISR is activated. If it is a mobility from a SGSN to a MME and if\n    the MME supports location information change reporting, the MME shall\n    include the User Location Information (according to the supported\n    granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request, regardless of whether\n    location information change reporting had been requested in the\n    previous RAT by the PDN GW. If it is an inter MME mobility and if the\n    PDN GW requested location information change reporting, the MME\n    includes the User Location Information IE in this message if it is\n    different compared to the previously sent information. If the PDN GW\n    requested User CSG information, the MME also includes the User CSG\n    Information IE in this message. If either the UE Time Zone has changed\n    or Context Response message indicated pending UE Time Zone change\n    reporting (via Change to Report flag), the MME includes the UE Time\n    Zone IE in this message. If either the Serving Network has changed or\n    Context Response message indicated pending Serving Network change\n    reporting (via Change to Report flag) the MME includes the new Serving\n    Network IE in this message. In network sharing scenarios Serving\n    Network denotes the serving core network. If the old node is an old MME\n    at a Tracking Area Update with a MME change ISR Activated shall not be\n    indicated.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  The User CSG Information IE is only sent in step\u00a09 if the\n         \"Active flag\" is set in the TAU Request message.\n\n     When the Modify Access Bearers Request or Modify Bearer Request does\n    not indicate ISR Activated the S-GW deletes any ISR resources by\n    sending a Delete Bearer Request to the other CN node that has bearer\n    resources on the S-GW reserved.\n\n     If the new MME receives the EPS bearer context with SCEF, then the new\n    MME updates the SCEF as defined in TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74].\n\n     For Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, if the DL data is buffered in\n    the Serving GW, and if this is a Tracking Area Update without MME\n    change and the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the\n    UE in the MME has not expired, or if this is a Tracking Area Update\n    with MME change and the old MME/old S4-SGSN indicated Buffered DL Data\n    Waiting in the Context Response in step\u00a05, the MME shall also indicate\n    S11-U tunnelling of NAS user data and include it's own S11-U IP address\n    and MME DL TEID for DL data forwarding by the SGW in the Modify Bearer\n    Request. The MME may also do so without DL data buffered in the SGW.\n\n     If the UE is using the LTE-M RAT type and the PDN GW expects the LTE-M\n    RAT type reporting as specified in clause\u00a05.11.5, the MME also includes\n    the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag to indicate to the Serving GW\n    to forward the LTE-M RAT type to the PDN GW.\n\n  10.  If the RAT type has changed, or the Serving GW has received the User\n    Location Information IE or the UE Time Zone IE or User CSG Information\n    IE and/or the Serving Network IE from the MME in step\u00a09, the Serving GW\n    informs the PDN GW(s) about this information that e.g. can be used for\n    charging, by sending the message Modify Bearer Request (RAT type) per\n    PDN connection to the PDN GW(s) concerned. User Location Information IE\n    and/or UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE and/or Serving\n    Network IE are also included if they are present in step\u00a09.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons and the PDN GW charging is paused, then the SGW shall send\n    Modify Bearer Request message with PDN Charging Pause Stop Indication\n    to inform the PDN GW that the charging is no longer paused. Other IEs\n    are not included in this message.\n\n     If LTE-M RAT type and the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag were\n    received at step\u00a09, the Serving GW shall include the LTE-M RAT type in\n    the Modify Bearer Request message to the PGW. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    includes RAT type WB-E-UTRAN.\n\n  11.  If dynamic PCC is deployed, and RAT type information or UE location\n    information needs to be conveyed from the PDN GW to the PCRF, then the\n    PDN GW shall send this information to the PCRF by means of an IP-CAN\n    Session Modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  The PDN GW does not need to wait for the PCRF response, but\n         continues in the next step. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS\n         bearer modification the PDN GW should initiate a bearer update\n         procedure.\n\n  12.  The PDN GW updates its context field to allow DL PDUs to be routed\n    to the correct Serving GW. PDN GW returns a Modify Bearer Response\n    (MSISDN) to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is included if the PDN GW has it\n    stored in its UE context. If there has been a RAT change towards E-\n    UTRAN and location information change reporting is required and\n    supported in the target MME, the PDN GW shall provide MS Info Change\n    Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer Response.\n\n  13.  The Serving GW updates its bearer context. If ISR Activated is\n    indicated in step\u00a09 and RAT Type received in step\u00a09 indicates E-UTRAN,\n    then the Serving GW only updates the MME Control Plane Address stored\n    locally and keep the SGSN related information unchanged. Also, in this\n    case, if the Serving GW has maintained the SGSN address for user plane\n    and S4 GTP-U TEID, the Serving GW removes the SGSN address for user\n    plane and S4 GTP-U TEID locally. Otherwise the Serving GW shall update\n    all of the information stored locally for this UE with the related\n    information received from the MME. This allows the Serving GW to route\n    Bearer PDUs to the PDN GW when received from eNodeB. The Serving GW\n    shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW address and TEID for\n    uplink traffic, MS Info Change Reporting Action) message to the new MME\n    as a response to a Modify Bearer Request message, or a Modify Access\n    Bearers Response (Serving GW address and TEID for uplink traffic) as a\n    response to a Modify Access Bearers Request message. If the Serving GW\n    cannot serve the MME Request in the Modify Access Bearers Request\n    message without S5/S8 signalling other than to unpause charging in the\n    PDN GW or without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over\n    the S5/S8 interface, it shall respond to the MME with indicating that\n    the modifications are not limited to S1-U bearers, and the MME shall\n    repeat its request using Modify Bearer Request message per PDN\n    connection.\n\n     When the MME receives the Modify Bearer Response or the Modify Access\n    Bearers Response message, the MME checks if there is a \"Availability\n    after DDN Failure\" monitoring event or a \"UE Reachability\" monitoring\n    event configured for the UE in the MME and in such a case sends an\n    event notification (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] for further information).\n\n     For Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, if the MME address and MME DL\n    TEID are provided in step\u00a09, the Serving GW includes Serving GW address\n    and Serving GW UL TEID in the Modify Bearer Response message. The DL\n    data is sent to the MME from the Serving GW.\n\n     The buffered DL data is sent to the UE as described in steps 12-14 of\n    clause\u00a05.3.4B.3.\n\n  14.  The new MME verifies whether it holds subscription data for the UE\n    identified by the GUTI, the additional GUTI or by the IMSI received\n    with the context data from the old CN node.\n\n     If there are no subscription data in the new MME for this UE, or for\n    some network sharing scenario (e.g. GWCN) if the PLMN-ID of the TAI\n    supplied by the eNodeB is different from that of the GUTI in the UE's\n    context, then the new MME informs the HSS of the change of MME by\n    sending an Update Location Request (MME Id, IMSI, ULR-Flags, MME\n    Capabilities, Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, UE\n    SRVCC capability, equivalent PLMN list, ME Identity (IMEISV)) message\n    to the HSS. ULR-Flags indicates that update location is sent from an\n    MME and the MME registration shall be updated in HSS. The HSS does not\n    cancel any SGSN registration. The MME capabilities indicate the MME's\n    support for regional access restrictions functionality. The inclusion\n    of the equivalent PLMN list indicates that the MME supports the inter-\n    PLMN handover to a CSG cell in an equivalent PLMN using the\n    subscription information of the target PLMN. The \"Homogenous Support of\n    IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication (see clause\u00a04.3.5.8A) shall not\n    be included unless the MME has completed its evaluation of the support\n    of \"IMS Voice over PS Session\" as specified in clause\u00a04.3.5.8. The ME\n    Identity is included if step\u00a05 caused the MME to retrieve the IMEISV\n    from the UE.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  At this step, the MME may not have all the information needed to\n         determine the setting of the IMS voice over PS Session Supported\n         indication for this UE (see clause\u00a04.3.5.8). Hence the MME can send\n         the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" later on in\n         this procedure.\n\n     If the UE initiates the TAU procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous\n    CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the\n    VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and the MME needs to retrieve the\n    CSG subscription information of the UE from the CSS, the MME initiates\n    the Update CSG Location Procedure with CSS as described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.12.\n\n     If the MME determines that only the UE SRVCC capability has changed,\n    the MME sends a Notify Request to the HSS to inform about the changed\n    UE SRVCC capability.\n\n     If all the EPS bearers of the UE have emergency ARP value, the new MME\n    may skip the update location procedure or proceed even if the update\n    location fails.\n\n     If the UE is RLOS attached, the new MME skips the update location\n    procedure and the TAU procedure proceeds.\n\n  15.  The HSS sends a Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation type) message to\n    the old MME with a Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure.\n\n  16.  When receiving a Cancel Location message and the timer started in\n    step 4 is not running, the old MME removes the MM and bearer contexts.\n    Otherwise, the contexts are removed when the timer expires. It also\n    ensures that the MM context is kept in the old MME for the case the UE\n    initiates another TAU procedure before completing the ongoing TAU\n    procedure to the new MME. The old MME acknowledges with a Cancel\n    Location Ack (IMSI) message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  ISR Activated is never indicated from new to old MME.\n\n     So an old MME deletes all the bearer resources of the UE in any case\n    when the timer started in step\u00a04 expires, which is independent on\n    receiving a Cancel Location message.\n\n  17.  When receiving the Context Acknowledge message and if the UE is Iu\n    Connected, the old SGSN sends an Iu Release Command message to the RNC\n    after the timer started in step\u00a04 has expired.\n\n  18.  The RNC responds with an Iu Release Complete message.\n\n  19.  The HSS acknowledges the Update Location Request by returning an\n    Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription Data) message to the new MME\n    after the cancelling of the old MME context is finished. If all checks\n    are successful, the MME constructs an MM context for the UE. The\n    Subscription Data may contain the CSG subscription data for the\n    registered PLMN and for the equivalent PLMN list requested by MME in\n    step\u00a014.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Enhanced Coverage Restricted\n    parameter. If received from the HSS, MME stores this Enhanced Coverage\n    Restricted parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Service Gap Time. If received from\n    the HSS, the MME stores this Service Gap Time in the MME MM context for\n    the UE and passes it to the UE in the Tracking Area Update Accept\n    message if the UE has indicated Service Gap Control capability.\n\n     The subscription data may contain Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter that applies to the UEs on a specific RAT, e.g. NB-IoT. If\n    received from the HSS, MME stores this Subscribed Paging Time Window\n    parameter in the MME MM context.\n\n     If the UE initiates the TAU procedure at a CSG cell, the new MME shall\n    check whether the CSG ID and associated PLMN is contained in the CSG\n    subscription and is not expired. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN is\n    not present or expired, the MME shall send a Tracking Area Update\n    reject message to the UE with an appropriate cause value. The UE shall\n    remove the CSG ID and associated PLMN from its Allowed CSG list if\n    present.\n\n     If the Update Location is rejected by the HSS, the new MME rejects the\n    TAU Request from the UE with an appropriate cause sent in the TAU\n    Reject message to the UE. In such cases, the new MME releases any local\n    MME EPS Bearer contexts for this particular UE.\n\n  20.  If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions\n    (e.g. CSG restrictions) (received in update location procedure in\n    step\u00a019) the UE is not allowed to access the TA:\n\n    -  The MME rejects the Tracking Area Update Request with an appropriate\n       cause to the UE.\n\n    -  For UEs with emergency EPS bearers, i.e. at least one EPS bearer has\n       an ARP value reserved for emergency services, the new MME accepts the\n       Tracking Area Update Request and deactivates all non-emergency PDN\n       connections as specified in clause\u00a05.10.3. If the Tracking Area\n       Update procedure is initiated in ECM-IDLE state, all non-emergency\n       EPS bearers are deactivated by the Tracking Area Update procedure\n       without bearer deactivation signalling between the UE and the MME.\n\n     The MME responds to the UE with a Tracking Area Update Accept (GUTI,\n    TAI-list, EPS bearer status, NAS sequence number, NAS-MAC, ISR\n    Activated, IMS Voice over PS session supported, Emergency Service\n    Support indicator, LCS Support Indication, Supported Network Behaviour,\n    Service Gap Time, Enhanced Coverage Restricted, Indication of support\n    of 15 EPS bearers per UE) message. If the active flag is set the\n    Handover Restriction List may be sent to eNodeB as eNodeB handles the\n    roaming restrictions and access restrictions in the Intra E-UTRAN case.\n    If the active flag is set in the TAU Request message the user plane\n    setup procedure is activated in conjunction with the TAU Accept\n    message. If this is a Tracking Area Update without MME change and the\n    DL Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the UE in the MME\n    has not expired, or if this is a Tracking Area Update with MME change\n    and the old MME/old S4-SGSN indicated Buffered DL Data Waiting in the\n    Context Response in step\u00a05, the user plane setup procedure is activated\n    even if the MME did not receive the active flag in the TAU Request\n    message. If the new MME receives the Downlink Data Notification message\n    or any downlink signalling message while the UE is still connected, the\n    user plane setup procedure may be activated even if the new MME did not\n    receive the active flag in the TAU Request message. The procedure is\n    described in detail in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. The message sequence should be\n    the same as for the UE triggered Service Request procedure specified in\n    clause 5.3.4.1 from the step when MME establish the bearers(s). The EPS\n    bearer status indicates the active bearers in the network. The UE\n    removes any internal resources related to bearers not marked active in\n    the received EPS bearer status. If the EPS bearer status information\n    was in the TAU Request, the MME shall indicate the EPS bearer status to\n    the UE. If ISR Activated is indicated to the UE, this indicates that\n    its P-TMSI and RAI shall remain registered with the network and shall\n    remain valid in the UE. At a Tracking Area Update with an MME change\n    ISR Activated shall not be indicated. At a Tracking Area Update without\n    an MME change, if ISR is activated for the UE when the MME receives the\n    Tracking Area Update Request, the MME should maintain ISR by indicating\n    ISR Activated in the Tracking Area Update Accept message. Handover\n    Restriction List is described in clause 4.3.5.7 \"Mobility\n    Restrictions\". The MME sets the IMS Voice over PS session supported as\n    described in clause\u00a04.3.5.8.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS bearer status included in the TAU Accept\n    message.\n\n     The MME indicates the CIoT EPS Optimisations it supports and prefers\n    in the Supported Network Behaviour information as defined in\n    clause\u00a04.3.5.10.\n\n     If there is a Service Gap timer running for the UE in the MME, the MME\n    shall ignore the active flag and signalling active flag and not perform\n    any of the actions related to these flags.\n\n     The MME shall include the Service Gap Time in the TAU Accept message\n    if the UE has indicated Service Gap Control capability and either if\n    Service Gap Time was received in step\u00a019 from HSS in the subscription\n    information or if the Service Gap Time in the subscription information\n    has been updated by HSS User Profile management (i.e. the Insert\n    Subscriber Data procedure in clause\u00a05.3.9.2).\n\n     If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage\n    in step\u00a01, the MME sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the\n    eNB in the S1-AP message as defined in clause\u00a04.3.28. The MME also\n    sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the UE in the TAU\n    Accept message. UE shall store Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter\n    and shall use the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to\n    determine if enhanced coverage feature should be used or not.\n\n     If the MME successfully obtained Header Compression Configuration\n    parameters in step\u00a05 it indicates he continued use of previous\n    negotiated configuration to the UE in the Header Compression Context\n    Status for each EPS Bearer of the UE. When Header Compression Context\n    Status indicates that the previous negotiated configuration can no\n    longer be used for some EPS bearers, the UE shall stop performing\n    header compression and decompression when sending or receiving data\n    using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation on these EPS bearers.\n\n     The MME checks if there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\"\n    monitoring event or a \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for\n    the UE in the MME for which an event notification has not yet been\n    sent. In such a case an event notification is sent (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]\n    for further information).\n\n     If the MME did not receive the Voice support match indicator in the MM\n    Context, then the MME may send a UE Radio Capability Match Request to\n    the eNB as described in clause\u00a05.3.14. If the MME hasn't received Voice\n    support match indicator from the eNB then based on implementation MME\n    may set IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication and update it at\n    a later stage. After step\u00a014, and in parallel to any of the preceding\n    steps, the MME shall send a Notify Request (Homogeneous Support of IMS\n    Voice over PS Sessions) message to the HSS:\n\n    -  If the MME has evaluated the support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions,\n       see clause\u00a04.3.5.8, and\n\n    -  If the MME determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous\n       Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause\u00a04.3.5.8A.\n\n     The Emergency Service Support indicator informs the UE that Emergency\n    bearer services are supported. LCS Support Indication indicates whether\n    the network supports the EPC-MO-LR and/or CS-MO-LR as described in\n    TS\u00a023.271\u00a0[57]. Indication for support of 15 EPS bearers per UE\n    indicates the network supports 15 EPS bearers as defined in\n    clause\u00a04.12.\n\n     When receiving the TAU Accept message and there is no ISR Activated\n    indication the UE shall set its TIN to \"GUTI\". When ISR Activated is\n    indicated and the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" the UE's TIN shall not be\n    changed. When ISR Activated is indicated and the TIN is \"P-TMSI\" or\n    \"RAT-related TMSI\" the UE shall set its TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\".\n\n     For an MME change ISR is not activated by the new MME to avoid context\n    transfer procedures with two old CN nodes.\n\n     For an emergency attached UE, emergency ISR is not activated.\n\n     If the TAU procedure is initiated by manual CSG selection and occurs\n    via a CSG cell, the UE upon receiving TAU Accept message shall add the\n    CSG ID and associated PLMN to its Allowed CSG list if it is not already\n    present. Manual CSG selection is not supported if the UE has emergency\n    bearers established.\n\n     If the UE included extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element, the MME includes extended idle mode DRX parameters information\n    element in the TAU accept if it decides to enable extended idle mode\n    DRX with Paging Time Window length assigned considering Subscribed\n    Paging Time Window (if available) and the local policy.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed in conjunction with the TAU\n    Accept message and the TAU is performed via a hybrid cell, then the MME\n    shall send an indication whether the UE is a CSG member to the RAN\n    along with the S1-MME control message. Based on this information the\n    RAN may perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG members.\n\n  NOTE\u00a010: If the UE receives a TAU Accept message via a hybrid cell, the\n         UE does not add the corresponding CSG ID and associated PLMN to its\n         Allowed CSG list. Adding a CSG ID and associated PLMN to the UE's\n         local Allowed CSG list for a hybrid cell is performed only by OTA\n         or OMA DM procedures.\n\n     If the UE receives a Service Gap Time in the TAU Accept message, the\n    UE shall store this parameter and apply Service Gap Control (see\n    clause\u00a04.3.17.9).\n\n     If the UE has indicated support for dual connectivity with NR in the\n    TAU Request and the UE is not allowed to use NR as Secondary RAT, the\n    MME indicates that to the UE in the TAU Accept message.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed and if RACS is supported and MME\n    has UE Radio Capability ID in UE context, it signals the UE Radio\n    Capability ID to the eNB as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a. If the eNB does\n    not have mapping between the specific UE Radio Capability ID and the UE\n    radio capabilities, it shall use the procedure described in\n    TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36] to retrieve the mapping from the Core Network.\n\n  21.  If the GUTI was changed the UE acknowledges the new GUTI by\n    returning a Tracking Area Update Complete message to the MME.\n\n     When the \"Active flag\" is not set in the TAU Request message and the\n    Tracking Area Update was not initiated in ECM-CONNECTED state, the MME\n    releases the signalling connection with UE, according to clause\u00a05.3.5.\n    For a UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, when the\n    \"Signalling active flag\" is set, the new MME shall not release the NAS\n    signalling connection with the UE immediately after the TAU procedure\n    is completed.\n\n  NOTE\u00a011: The new MME may initiate E-RAB establishment (see\n         TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]) after execution of the security functions, or wait\n         until completion of the TA update procedure. For the UE, E-RAB\n         establishment may occur anytime after the TA update request is\n         sent.\n\nIn the case of a rejected tracking area update operation, due to regional\nsubscription, roaming restrictions, or access restrictions (see\nTS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27] and TS\u00a023.008\u00a0[28]) the new MME should not construct an MM\ncontext for the UE. In the case of receiving the subscriber data from HSS,\nthe new MME may construct an MM context and store the subscriber data for\nthe UE to optimise signalling between the MME and the HSS. A reject shall\nbe returned to the UE with an appropriate cause and the S1 connection shall\nbe released. Upon return to idle, the UE shall act according to\nTS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\nIf the new MME is unable to update the bearer context in one or more P-GWs,\nthe new MME shall deactivate the corresponding bearer contexts as described\nin clause \"MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation Procedure\". This\nshall not cause the MME to reject the tracking area update.\n\nThe new MME shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on the\nreceived APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Context Response\nmessage and then store the new Maximum APN restriction value.\n\nThe bearer contexts shall be prioritized by the new MME. If the new MME is\nunable to support the same number of active bearer contexts as received\nfrom old MME/SGSN, the prioritisation is used to decide which bearer\ncontexts to maintain active and which ones to delete. In any case, the new\nMME shall first update all contexts in one or more P-GWs and then\ndeactivate the context(s) that it cannot maintain as described in clause\n\"MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation Procedure\". This shall not\ncause the MME to reject the tracking area update.\n\nThe new MME shall not deactivate emergency service related EPS bearers,\ni.e. EPS bearers with ARP value reserved for emergency services.\n\n  NOTE\u00a012: If MS (UE) was in PMM-CONNECTED state the bearer contexts are\n         sent already in the Forward Relocation Request message as described\n         in clause \"Serving RNS relocation procedures\" of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\nIf the tracking area update procedure fails a maximum allowable number of\ntimes, or if the MME returns a Tracking Area Update Reject (Cause) message,\nthe UE shall enter EMM DEREGISTERED state.\n\nIf the new MME identifies that the RAT type has changed, the MME checks the\nsubscription information to identify for each APN whether to maintain the\nPDN connection, disconnect the PDN connection with a reactivation request,\nor, disconnect the PDN connection without reactivation request. If the MME\ndecides to deactivate a PDN connection it performs MME-initiated PDN\nConnection Deactivation procedure after the tracking area update procedure\nis completed but before the S1/RRC interface connection is released.\nExisting ESM cause values as specified in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46] (e.g. #39,\n\"reactivation requested\"; #66 \"Requested APN not supported in current RAT\nand PLMN combination\"; and for a dedicated bearer, possibly #37 \"EPS QoS\nnot accepted\") are used to cause predictable UE behaviour. If all the PDN\nconnections are disconnected and the UE does not support \"attach without\nPDN connectivity\", the MME shall request the UE to detach and reattach.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Routing Area Update with MME interaction and without S-GW change", "numbering": "5.3.3.3", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.3.3  Routing Area Update with MME interaction and without S-GW change\n\nThe Routing Area Update without S-GW change procedure takes place when a UE\nthat is registered with an MME selects a UTRAN or GERAN cell and the S-GW\nis not changed by the procedure. In this case, the UE changes to a Routing\nArea that the UE has not yet registered with the network. This procedure is\ninitiated by an ECM-IDLE state UE and may also be initiated if the UE is in\nECM-CONNECTED state. The RA update case is illustrated in Figure 5.3.3.3-1.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  This procedure covers the MME to 2G or 3G SGSN RAU.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n Figure 5.3.3.3-1: Routing Area Update with MME interaction and without S-GW\n                                   change\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined\n         in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2]. Steps 8 and 10 concern GTP based S5/S8.\n\n  1. The UE selects a UTRAN or GERAN cell. This cell is in a Routing Area\n    that the UE not yet registered with the network, or the UE reselects a\n    UTRAN or GERAN cell and the TIN indicates \"GUTI\". The UE in ECM-\n    CONNECTED state may change to the GERAN cell through Network Assisted\n    Cell Change (NACC).\n\n  2a.  The UE sends a Routing Area Update Request (old P-TMSI, P-TMSI Type,\n    old RAI, UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability, P-TMSI\n    Signature, additional P-TMSI/RAI, KSI, Voice domain preference and UE's\n    usage setting) message to the new SGSN. The UE shall set the P-TMSI\n    Type to indicate whether the P-TMSI is a native P-TMSI or is mapped\n    from a GUTI.\n\n     If the UE's internal TIN indicates \"GUTI\" and the UE holds a valid\n    GUTI then the UE indicates the GUTI as the old P-TMSI and old RAI. If\n    the UE's TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" and the UE holds\n    a valid P-TMSI and related RAI then these two elements are indicated as\n    old P-TMSI and old RAI. Mapping a GUTI to a P-TMSI and an RAI is\n    specified in TS\u00a023.003\u00a0[9].\n\n     If the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and related RAI and the old P-TMSI and\n    old RAI indicate a P-TMSI/RAI mapped from a GUTI, then the UE indicates\n    these parameters as additional P-TMSI/RAI.\n\n     The old P-TMSI is indicated in the RAU Request message for Iu-mode\n    only. For Gb mode the TLLI is derived from the value that is determined\n    as the old P-TMSI according to the rules above. The routing parameter\n    that is signalled in the RRC signalling to the RNC for routing to the\n    SGSN is derived from the identifier that is signalled as the old P-TMSI\n    according to the rules above. For a combined MME/SGSN the RAN is\n    configured to route the NRI(s) of this combined node to the same\n    combined node. The RAN is also configured to route NRI(s) of P-TMSIs\n    that are generated by the UE's mapping of the GUTIs allocated by the\n    combined node. Such a RAN configuration may also be used for separate\n    nodes to avoid changing nodes in the pool caused by inter RAT mobility.\n\n     If the UE has a follow-on request, i.e. if there is pending uplink\n    traffic (signalling or data), the 3G\u00a0SGSN may use, as an implementation\n    option, the follow-on request indication to release or keep the Iu\n    connection after the completion of the RA update procedure.\n\n     KSI is mapped from an eKSI identifying a KASME if the UE indicates a P-\n    TMSI mapped from GUTI in the information element \"old P-TMSI\". KSI\n    identifies a (CK, IK) pair if the UE indicates a P-TMSI in the\n    information element \"old P-TMSI\".\n\n     The UE sets the voice domain preference and UE's usage setting\n    according to its configuration, as described in clause\u00a04.3.5.9.\n\n  2b.  The RNC shall add the Routing Area Identity, CSG access mode, CSG ID\n    before forwarding the message to the SGSN. This RA identity corresponds\n    to the RAI in the MM system information sent by the RNC to the UE. The\n    BSS shall add the Cell Global Identity (CGI) of the cell where the UE\n    is located before passing the message to the new SGSN. CSG ID is\n    provided by RAN if the UE sends the RAU Request message via a CSG cell\n    or a hybrid cell. CSG access mode is provided if the UE sends the RAU\n    Request message via a hybrid cell. If the CSG access mode is not\n    provided but the CSG ID is provided, the SGSN shall consider the cell\n    as a CSG cell. For SIPTO at the Local Network the with stand-alone GW\n    architecture the RNC includes the Local Home Network ID in the Initial\n    UE Message and in Direct Transfer message if the target cell is in a\n    Local Home Network.\n\n  3. The new S4\u00a0SGSN determines the type of the old node, i.e. MME or SGSN,\n    as specified in clause\u00a04.3.19, uses the old RAI received from the UE to\n    derive the old MME address, and sends a Context Request (P-TMSI, old\n    RAI, New SGSN Address, P-TMSI Signature) message to the old MME to get\n    the context for the UE. To validate the Context Request the old MME\n    uses a NAS token mapped from the P-TMSI Signature. If the UE is not\n    known in the old MME, the old MME responds with an appropriate error\n    cause. If integrity check fails in the old MME, the old MME responds\n    with an appropriate error cause which shall initiate the security\n    functions in the new S4 SGSN. If the security functions authenticate\n    the UE correctly, the new S4 SGSN shall send a Context Request (IMSI,\n    old RAI, New SGSN Address, UE Validated) message to the old MME.UE\n    Validated indicates that the new S4 SGSN has authenticated the UE. If\n    the new S4 SGSN indicates that it has authenticated the UE or if the\n    old MME authenticates the UE, the old MME starts a timer.\n\n     If the UE with emergency bearers is not authenticated in the old MME\n    (in a network supporting unauthenticated UEs) the old MME continues the\n    procedure with sending a Context Response and starting the timer also\n    when it cannot validate the Context Request.\n\n  4. The old MME responds with one Context Response (IMSI, ME Identity (if\n    available), KSI, CK, IK, unused Authentication Quintets, EPS Bearer\n    Contexts, Serving GW signalling Address and TEID(s), ISR Supported, MS\n    Info Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information Reporting\n    Action (if available), UE Time Zone, UE Core Network Capability, UE\n    Specific DRX Parameters, Change to Report (if present)) message. The\n    PDN\u00a0GW Address and TEID(s) (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE Keys (PMIP-\n    based S5/S8) for uplink traffic and control plane, and the TI(s) is\n    part of the EPS Bearer context(s). The unused Authentication Quintets\n    in the MM Context may be sent if stored by the MME and the MME received\n    the unused Authentication Quintets from the same SGSN previously. ISR\n    Supported is indicated if the old MME and associated Serving GW are\n    capable to activate ISR for the UE.\n\n     If the UE receives emergency bearer services from the old MME and the\n    UE is UICCless, IMSI can not be included in the Context Response. For\n    emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be authenticated, then the\n    IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also, in this case, security\n    parameters are included only if available.\n\n     The new S4\u00a0SGSN shall ignore the UE Core Network Capability contained\n    in the Context Response only when it has previously received an UE Core\n    Network Capability in the Routing Area Update Request. If UE is not\n    known in the old MME, the old MME responds with an appropriate error\n    cause.\n\n     Change to Report flag is included by the old MME if reporting of\n    change of UE Time Zone, or Serving Network, or both towards Serving GW\n    / PDN GW was deferred by the old MME.\n\n     The new SGSN maps the EPS bearers to PDP contexts 1-to-1 and maps the\n    EPS Bearer QoS parameter values of an EPS bearer to the Release\u00a099 QoS\n    parameter values of a PDP context as defined in Annex E. The PDP\n    context(s) are established in the indicated order. The SGSN deactivates\n    the PDP contexts which cannot be established.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW, the old MME shall include the Local\n    Home Network ID of the old cell in the EPS Bearer context corresponding\n    to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS Bearer Context(s) included in the Context\n    Response message.\n\n     The old MME only transfers the EPS Bearer Context(s) that the new SGSN\n    supports. If not supported, EPS Bearer Context(s) of non-IP PDN\n    connection are not transferred to the new SGSN. EPS Bearer Context(s)\n    of Ethernet PDN connection type are not transferred to the new SGSN. If\n    the EPS Bearer Context(s) of a PDN connection has not been transferred,\n    the old MME shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed\n    and release that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN\n    disconnection procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n  5. Security functions may be executed. Procedures are defined in\n    clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\".\n\n     If the new SGSN is configured to allow emergency bearer services for\n    unauthenticated UE the new SGSN behave as follows:\n\n    -  where a UE has only emergency bearer services, the SGSN either skip\n       the authentication and security procedure or accepts that the\n       authentication may fail and continues the Routing Area Update\n       procedure; or\n\n    -  where a UE has both emergency and non emergency bearer services and\n       authentication fails, the SGSN continues the Routing Area Update\n       procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDP contexts as\n       specified in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\n  6. The new S4\u00a0SGSN sends a Context Acknowledge (ISR Activated) message to\n    the old MME. Unless ISR is indicated by the new S4\u00a0SGSN, the old MME\n    marks in its context that the information in the GWs is invalid. This\n    ensures that the old MME updates the GW if the UE initiates a TAU\n    procedure back to the old MME before completing the ongoing RAU\n    procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Updating the GWs refers to modification of session(s) on the\n         Serving GW. This will result in successful re-establishment of the\n         S11/S4 tunnel between the MME/SGSN and the Serving GW.\n\n     ISR Activated indicates to the old MME that it shall maintain the UE's\n    contexts and the MME stops the timer started in step 3. In this case,\n    if the Implicit Detach timer is running, the old MME shall re-start it\n    with a slightly larger value than the UE's E-UTRAN Deactivate ISR\n    timer. When ISR Activated is not indicated and this timer expires the\n    old MME deletes all bearer resources of that UE. As the Context\n    Acknowledge from the new S4\u00a0SGSN does not include any S-GW change the\n    old MME does not send any Delete Session Request message to the S-GW.\n    The SGSN shall not activate ISR if the associated Serving GW does not\n    support ISR.\n\n     If the security functions do not authenticate the UE correctly, then\n    the RAU is rejected, and the new S4\u00a0SGSN sends a reject indication to\n    the old MME. The old MME shall continue as if the Identification and\n    Context Request was never received.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, the steps 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are skipped.\n\n     If the new SGSN identifies that the RAT type has changed, the SGSN\n    checks the subscription information to identify for each APN whether to\n    maintain the PDN connection, disconnect the PDN connection with a\n    reactivation request or disconnect PDN connection without reactivation\n    request. If the SGSN decides to deactive a PDN connection it performs\n    SGSN-initiated PDN Connection Deactivation procedure after tracking\n    area procedure is completed. Existing SM cause values as specified in\n    TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[47] (e.g. #39, \"reactivation requested\"; #66 \"Requested APN\n    not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination\"; and for a dedicated\n    bearer, possibly #37 \"QoS not accepted\") are used to cause predictable\n    UE behaviour.\n\n  7. In this procedure flow the Serving GW is not relocated. The SGSN sends\n    a Modify Bearer Request (new SGSN Address and TEID, RAT type, ISR\n    Activated) message per PDN connection to the Serving GW. If indicated,\n    the information ISR Activated indicates that ISR is activated. As it is\n    a mobility from E-UTRAN, if the target SGSN supports location\n    information change reporting, the target SGSN shall include the User\n    Location Information (according to the supported granularity) in the\n    Modify Bearer Request, regardless of whether location information\n    change reporting had been requested in the previous RAT by the PDN GW.\n    If the PDN GW requested User CSG information, the SGSN also includes\n    the User CSG information IE in this message. If either the UE Time Zone\n    has changed , or Context Response message from old MME indicated\n    pending UE Time Zone change reporting (via Change to Report flag), the\n    SGSN includes the UE Time Zone IE in this message. If either the\n    Serving Network has changed, or Context Response message from old MME\n    indicated pending Serving Network change reporting (via Change to\n    Report flag) the SGSN includes the new Serving Network IE in this\n    message. In network sharing scenarios Serving Network denotes the\n    serving core network.\n\n     When the Modify Bearer Request does not indicate ISR Activated the S-\n    GW deletes any ISR resources by sending a Delete Bearer Request to the\n    other CN node that has bearer resources on the S-GW reserved. RAT type\n    indicates a change in radio access.\n\n     If ISR Activated is indicated or SGSN and SGW are configured to\n    release S4 U-Plane when EPS Bearer Contexts associated with the\n    released RABs are to be preserved, the SGSN does not send SGSN address\n    and TEID for U-Plane in Modify Bearer Request.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The User CSG Information IE is not sent in step\u00a07 if the \"follow-\n         on request indication\" indicates releasing the Iu connection after\n         the completion of the RA update procedure.\n\n  8. If the RAT type has changed or the Serving GW has received the User\n    Location Information IE and/or the UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG\n    information IE and/or the Serving Network IE from the MME in step\u00a07 the\n    Serving GW informs the PDN GW(s) about the change of this information\n    that e.g. can be used for charging, by sending the message Modify\n    Bearer Request (RAT type) per PDN connection to the PDN GW(s)\n    concerned. User Location Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE and/or\n    User CSG information IE and/or Serving Network IE are also included if\n    they are present in step\u00a07.\n\n  9. If dynamic PCC is deployed, and RAT type information or UE location\n    information needs to be conveyed from the PDN GW to the PCRF, then the\n    PDN GW shall send this information to the PCRF by means of an IP-CAN\n    Session Modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The PDN GW does not need to wait for the PCRF response, but\n         continues in the next step. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS\n         bearer modification the PDN GW should initiate a bearer update\n         procedure.\n\n  10.  The PDN GW updates its context field and returns a Modify Bearer\n    Response (MSISDN) message to the Serving GW. MSISDN is included if the\n    PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. If location information change\n    reporting is required and supported in the target SGSN, the PDN GW\n    shall provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer\n    Response.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW updates its context fields. If ISR Activated is\n    indicated in step 7 and RAT Type received in step 7 indicates UTRAN or\n    GERAN, then the Serving GW only updates the SGSN Control Plane Address\n    and keeps the MME related information unchanged. Otherwise the Serving\n    GW shall update all of the information stored locally for this UE with\n    the related information received from the SGSN. Then the Serving GW\n    returns a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW address and TEID for\n    uplink traffic, MS Info Change Reporting Action) message.\n\n     When the SGSN receives the Modify Bearer Response message, the SGSN\n    checks if there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event\n    or a \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the\n    SGSN and in such a case sends an event notification (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]\n    for further information).\n\n  12.  The new SGSN verifies whether it holds subscription data for the UE\n    identified by the P-TMSI, the additional PTMSI/RAI or by the IMSI\n    received with the context data from the old CN node.\n\n     The additional P-TMSI/RAI allows the new SGSN to find any already\n    existing UE context stored in the new SGSN. If there are no\n    subscription data in the new SGSN for this UE, or for some network\n    sharing scenario (e.g. GWCN) if the PLMN-ID of the RAI supplied by the\n    RNC is different from that of the RAI in the UE's context, then the new\n    SGSN informs the HSS of the change of the SGSN by sending an Update\n    Location (SGSN Number, SGSN Address, IMSI, Homogenous Support of IMS\n    Voice over PS Sessions, UE SRVCC capability, equivalent PLMN list)\n    message to the HSS. For \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS\n    Sessions\", see clause\u00a05.3.8A of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. The inclusion of the\n    equivalent PLMN list indicates that the SGSN supports the inter-PLMN\n    handover to a CSG cell in an equivalent PLMN using the subscription\n    information of the target PLMN.\n\n     If the UE initiates the RAU procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous\n    CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the\n    VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and the SGSN needs to retrieve the\n    CSG subscription information of the UE from the CSS, the SGSN initiates\n    the Update CSG Location Procedure with CSS as described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.12.\n\n  13.  The HSS sends a Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) message to\n    the old SGSN with the Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure.\n\n     When receiving the Cancel Location message the old SGSN removes all\n    the UE contexts. The old SGSN acknowledges with a Cancel Location Ack\n    (IMSI) message.\n\n  14.  When receiving the Context Acknowledge message from the new SGSN and\n    if the old MME has an S1-MME association for the UE, the source MME\n    sends a S1-U Release Command to the source eNodeB after the timer\n    started in step\u00a03 has expired. The RRC connection is released by the\n    source eNodeB. The source eNodeB confirms the release of the RRC\n    connection and of the S1-U connection by sending a S1-U Release\n    Complete message to the source MME.\n\n  15.  The HSS acknowledges the Update Location message by sending an\n    Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription Data) to the new SGSN. The\n    Subscription Data may contain the CSG subscription data for the\n    registered PLMN and for the equivalent PLMN list requested by SGSN in\n    step\u00a012.\n\n     If the UE initiates the RAU procedure at a CSG cell, the new S4 SGSN\n    shall check whether the CSG ID and associated PLMN is contained in the\n    CSG subscription and is not expired. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN\n    is not present or expired, the S4 SGSN shall send a RAU reject message\n    to the UE with an appropriate cause value. The UE shall remove the CSG\n    ID and associated PLMN from its Allowed CSG list if present.\n\n     If the Update Location is rejected by the HSS, the new SGSN rejects\n    the RAU Request from the UE with an appropriate cause sent in the RAU\n    Reject message to the UE. In such cases, the new SGSN releases any\n    local SGSN EPS Bearer contexts for this particular UE.\n\n  16.  Void.\n\n  17.  Void.\n\n  18.  If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions\n    (e.g. CSG restrictions) the UE is not allowed to access the RA:\n\n    -  For UEs with ongoing emergency bearer services, the new SGSN accept\n       the Routing Area Update Request and deactivates the non-emergency PDP\n       contexts as specified in clause\u00a09.2.4.2 in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. .If the\n       Routing Area Update procedure is initiated in PMM-IDLE/STANDBY state,\n       all non-emergency PDP Contexts are deactivated by the Routing Area\n       without PDP Context deactivation signalling between the UE and the\n       SGSN\n\n    -  For all other cases, the new SGSN rejects Routing Area Update\n       Request with an appropriate cause to the UE and notifies the HSS of\n       rejection (details of this notification is covered in stage 3).\n\n     The new SGSN responds to the UE with a Routing Area Update Accept (P-\n    TMSI, P-TMSI signature, ISR Activated, Emergency Service Support\n    indicator, PDP context status) message to the UE. P-TMSI is included if\n    the SGSN allocates a new P-TMSI. The Emergency Service Support\n    indicator informs the UE that Emergency bearer services are supported\n    over UTRAN.\n\n     If ISR Activated is indicated to the UE, its GUTI and list of TAs\n    shall remain registered with the network and shall remain valid in the\n    UE.\n\n     When receiving the RAU Accept message and there is no ISR Activated\n    indication the UE shall set its TIN to \"P-TMSI\". When ISR Activated is\n    indicated and the UE's TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" the TIN shall not be\n    changed. When ISR Activated is indicated and the UE's TIN indicates\n    \"GUTI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" the UE shall set its TIN to \"RAT-related\n    TMSI\".\n\n     If an SGSN change ISR is not activated by the new SGSN to avoid\n    context transfer procedures with two old CN nodes.\n\n     If the RAU procedure is initiated by manual CSG selection and occurs\n    via a CSG cell, the UE upon receiving the RAU Accept shall add the CSG\n    ID and associated PLMN to its Allowed CSG list if it is not already\n    present. Manual CSG selection is not supported if the UE has emergency\n    bearers established.\n\n     In Iu mode, if after step\u00a07 the new SGSN receives a Downlink Data\n    Notification message or any other downlink signalling message while the\n    UE is still connected, the new SGSN may prolong the PS signalling\n    connection with the UE.\n\n     If there is DL data buffered for a UE using power saving functions\n    (i.e. the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the UE\n    in the SGSN has not expired), the user plane setup is performed in\n    conjunction with the RAU Accept message.\n\n     With the PDP context status information, the UE shall deactivate all\n    those bearers contexts locally which are active in the UE, but are\n    indicated by the SGSN as being inactive.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed in conjunction with the RAU\n    Accept message and the RAU is performed via a hybrid cell, then the\n    SGSN shall send an indication whether the UE is a CSG member to the RAN\n    along with the RANAP message. Based on this information the RAN may\n    perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG members.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  If the UE receives a RAU Accept message via a hybrid cell, the\n         UE does not add the corresponding CSG ID and associated PLMN to its\n         Allowed CSG list. Adding a CSG ID and associated PLMN to the UE's\n         local Allowed CSG list for a hybrid cell is performed only by OTA\n         or OMA DM procedures.\n\n  19.  If P-TMSI was included in the Routing Area Update Accept message,\n    the UE acknowledges the new P-TMSI by returning a Routing Area Update\n    Complete message to the SGSN.\n\n  20.  For Iu-mode, if the UE has uplink data or signalling pending it\n    shall send a Service Request (P-TMSI, CKSN, Service Type) message to\n    the new SGSN. If a P-TMSI was allocated in step 18, that P-TMSI is the\n    one included in this message. Service Type specifies the requested\n    service. Service Type shall indicate one of the following: Data or\n    Signalling.\n\n  21.  If the UE has sent the Service Request, the new 3G SGSN requests the\n    RNC to establish a radio access bearer by sending a RAB Assignment\n    Request (RAB ID(s), QoS Profile(s), GTP SNDs, GTP SNUs, PDCP SNUs)\n    message to the RNC. If Direct Tunnel is established the SGSN provides\n    to the RNC the Serving GW's Address for User Plane and TEID for uplink\n    data.\n\n  22.  If the SGSN established Direct Tunnel in step 21) it shall send\n    Modify Bearer Request per PDN connection to the Serving GW and include\n    the RNC's Address for User Plane and downlink TEID for data. The\n    Serving GW updates the Address for User Plane and TEID for downlink\n    data and return a Modify Bearer Response.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  EPS does not support any CAMEL procedures.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  The new SGSN may initiate RAB establishment after execution of\n         the security functions (step\u00a05), or wait until completion of the RA\n         update procedure. For the MS, RAB establishment may occur anytime\n         after the RA update request is sent (step\u00a02).\n\nIn the case of a rejected routing area update operation, due to regional\nsubscription, roaming restrictions or access restrictions (see\nTS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27] and TS\u00a023.008\u00a0[28]) the new SGSN should not construct an MM\ncontext. In the case of receiving the subscriber data from HSS, the new\nSGSN may construct an MM context and store the subscriber data for the UE\nto optimise signalling between the SGSN and the HSS. A reject shall be\nreturned to the UE with an appropriate cause and the PS signalling\nconnection shall be released. Upon return to idle, the UE shall act\naccording to TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\nIf the network supports the MOCN configuration for network sharing, the\nSGSN may, if the UE is not a 'Network Sharing Supporting MS', in this case\ndecide to initiate redirection by sending a Reroute Command to the RNS, as\ndescribed in TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[24] instead of rejecting the routing area update.\n\nIf the new SGSN is unable to update the bearer context in one or more P-\nGWs, the new SGSN shall deactivate the corresponding bearer contexts as\ndescribed in clause \"SGSN-initiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure\" of\nTS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. This shall not cause the SGSN to reject the routing area\nupdate.\n\nThe new SGSN shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on the\nreceived APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Context Response\nmessage and then store the new Maximum APN restriction value.\n\nThe PDP contexts shall be prioritized by the new SGSN. If the new SGSN is\nunable to support the same number of active PDP contexts as received from\nthe old MME, the prioritisation is used to decide which PDP contexts to\nmaintain active and which ones to delete. In any case, the new SGSN shall\nfirst update all PDP contexts in one or more P-GWs and then deactivate the\nPDP context(s) that it cannot maintain as described in clause \"SGSN-\ninitiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure\" of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. This shall\nnot cause the SGSN to reject the routing area update.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  If the UE was in PMM-CONNECTED state the bearer contexts are\n         sent already in the Forward Relocation Request message as described\n         in clause \"Serving RNS relocation procedures\" of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\nIf the routing area update procedure fails a maximum allowable number of\ntimes, or if the SGSN returns a Routing Area Update Reject (Cause) message,\nthe UE shall enter PMM DETACHED state.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Void", "numbering": "5.3.3.4", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.3.4  Void\n\n\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Void", "numbering": "5.3.3.5", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.3.5  Void\n\n\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Routing Area Update with MME interaction and with S-GW change", "numbering": "5.3.3.6", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.3.6  Routing Area Update with MME interaction and with S-GW change\n\nThe Routing Area Update with S-GW change procedure takes place when a UE\nthat is registered with an MME selects a UTRAN or GERAN cell and the S-GW\nis changed by the procedure. In this case, the UE changes to a Routing Area\nthat the UE has not yet registered with the network. This procedure is\ninitiated by an ECM-IDLE state UE and may also be initiated if the UE is in\nECM-CONNECTED state. This RA update case is illustrated in Figure 5.3.3.6-\n1.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  This procedure covers the MME to 2G or 3G SGSN RAU.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n  Figure 5.3.3.6-1: Routing Area Update with MME interaction and with S-GW\n                                   change\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined\n         in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2]. Steps 8 and 10 concern GTP based S5/S8\n\n  1. The UE selects a UTRAN or GERAN cell. This cell is in a Routing Area\n    that the UE not yet registered with the network or the UE reselects a\n    UTRAN or GERAN cell and the TIN indicates \"GUTI\". The UE in ECM-\n    CONNECTED state may change to the GERAN cell through Network Assisted\n    Cell Change (NACC).\n\n  2a.  The UE sends a Routing Area Update Request (old RAI, old P-TMSI, P-\n    TMSI Type, UE Core Network Capability, MS Network Capability, P-TMSI\n    Signature, additional P-TMSI/RAI, KSI, Voice domain preference and UE's\n    usage setting) message to the new SGSN. The UE shall set the P-TMSI\n    Type to indicate whether the P-TMSI is a native P-TMSI or is mapped\n    from a GUTI.\n\n     If the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" and the UE holds a valid GUTI then\n    the UE indicates the GUTI as the old P-TMSI and old RAI. If the UE's\n    TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" and the UE holds a valid P-\n    TMSI and related RAI then these two elements are indicated as old P-\n    TMSI and old RAI. Mapping a GUTI to a P-TMSI and an RAI is specified in\n    TS\u00a023.003\u00a0[9].\n\n     If the UE holds a valid P-TMSI and related RAI and the old P-TMSI and\n    old RAI indicate a P-TMSI/RAI mapped from a GUTI, then the UE indicates\n    these parameters as additional P-TMSI/RAI.\n\n     The old P-TMSI is indicated in the RAU Request message for Iu-mode\n    only. For Gb mode the TLLI is derived from the value that is determined\n    as the old P-TMSI according to the rules above. The routing parameter\n    that is signalled in the RRC signalling to the RNC for routing to the\n    SGSN is derived from the identifier that is signalled as the old P-TMSI\n    according to the rules above. For a combined MME/SGSN the RAN is\n    configured to route the NRI(s) of this combined node to the same\n    combined node. The RAN is also configured to route NRI(s) of P-TMSIs\n    that are generated by the UE's mapping of the GUTIs allocated by the\n    combined node. Such a RAN configuration may also be used for separate\n    nodes to avoid changing nodes in the pool caused by inter RAT mobility.\n\n     If the UE has a follow-on request, i.e. if there is pending uplink\n    traffic (signalling or data), the 3G-SGSN may use, as an implementation\n    option, the follow-on request indication to release or keep the Iu\n    connection after the completion of the RA update procedure.\n\n     KSI is mapped from an eKSI identifying a KASME if the UE indicates a P-\n    TMSI mapped from GUTI in the information element \"old P-TMSI\". KSI\n    identifies a (CK, IK) pair if the UE indicates a P-TMSI in the\n    information element \"old P-TMSI\".\n\n     The UE sets the voice domain preference and UE's usage setting\n    according to its configuration, as described in clause\u00a04.3.5.9.\n\n  2b.  The RNC shall add the Routing Area Identity, CSG access mode, CSG ID\n    before forwarding the message to the SGSN. This RA identity corresponds\n    to the RAI in the MM system information sent by the RNC to the UE. The\n    BSS shall add the Cell Global Identity (CGI) of the cell where the UE\n    is located before passing the message to the new SGSN. CSG ID is\n    provided by RAN if the UE sends the RAU Request message via a CSG cell\n    or a hybrid cell. CSG access mode is provided if the UE sends the RAU\n    Request message via a hybrid cell. If the CSG access mode is not\n    provided but the CSG ID is provided, the SGSN shall consider the cell\n    as a CSG cell. For SIPTO at the Local Network the with stand-alone GW\n    architecture the RNC includes the Local Home Network ID in the Initial\n    UE Message and in Direct Transfer message if the target cell is in a\n    Local Home Network.\n\n  3. The new S4\u00a0SGSN determines the type of the old node, i.e. MME or SGSN,\n    as specified in clause\u00a04.3.19, uses the old RAI received from the UE to\n    derive the old MME address, and the new S4 SGSN sends a Context Request\n    (P-TMSI, old RAI, New SGSN Address, P-TMSI Signature) message to the\n    old MME to get the context for the UE. To validate the Context Request\n    the old MME uses a NAS token mapped from the P-TMSI Signature. If the\n    UE is not known in the old MME, the old MME responds with an\n    appropriate error cause. If integrity check fails in the old MME, the\n    old MME responds with an appropriate error cause which should initiate\n    the security functions in the new S4 SGSN. If the security functions\n    authenticate the UE correctly, the new S4 SGSN shall send a Context\n    Request (IMSI, old RAI, New SGSN Address, UE Validated) message to the\n    old MME. UE Validated indicates that the new S4 SGSN has authenticated\n    the UE. If the new S4\u00a0SGSN indicates that it has authenticated the UE\n    or if the old MME authenticates the UE, the old MME starts a timer.\n\n     If the UE with emergency bearers is not authenticated in the old MME\n    (in a network supporting unauthenticated UEs) the old MME continues the\n    procedure with sending a Context Response and starting the timer also\n    when it cannot validate the Context Request.\n\n  4. The old MME responds with a Context Response (MM Context, EPS Bearer\n    Contexts, Serving GW signalling Address and TEID(s), MS Info Change\n    Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information Reporting Action (if\n    available), UE Time Zone and ISR Supported) message. The MM context\n    contains security related information as well as other parameters\n    (including IMSI) as described in clause\u00a05.7.2 (Information Storage for\n    MME). The PDN GW Address and TEID(s) (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE Keys\n    (PMIP-based S5/S8) for uplink traffic and control plane, and the TI(s)\n    is part of the EPS Bearer context(s). The unused Authentication\n    Quintets in the MM Context may be sent if stored by the MME and if the\n    MME received the unused Authentication Quintets from the same SGSN\n    previously.\n\n     If the UE receives only emergency bearer services from the old MME and\n    the UE is UICCless, IMSI can not be included in the Context Response.\n    For emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be authenticated, then\n    the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also, in this case,\n    security parameters are included only if available. ISR Supported is\n    indicated if the old MME and associated Serving GW are capable to\n    activate ISR for the UE.\n\n     The new SGSN shall ignore the UE Core Network Capability in the MM\n    Context of the Context Response only when it has previously received an\n    UE Core Network Capability in the Routing Area Request. If UE is not\n    known in the old MME, the old MME responds with a appropriate error\n    cause.\n\n     The new SGSN maps the EPS bearers to PDP contexts 1-to-1 and maps the\n    EPS Bearer QoS parameter values of an EPS bearer to the Release\u00a099 QoS\n    parameter values of a bearer context as defined in Annex E. The PDP\n    context(s) are established in the indicated order. The SGSN deactivates\n    the PDP contexts which cannot be established.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW, the old MME shall include the Local\n    Home Network ID of the old cell in the EPS Bearer context corresponding\n    to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n     If the UE uses power saving functions and the DL Data Buffer\n    Expiration Time for the UE has not expired (see High latency\n    communication in clause\u00a04.3.17.7), the old MME indicates Buffered DL\n    Data Waiting in the Context Response. When this is indicated, the new\n    SGSN shall invoke data forwarding (corresponding to clause\u00a05.3.3.1A)\n    and setup the user plane in conjunction to the RAU procedure for\n    delivery of the buffered DL data to the UE.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, there is no EPS Bearer Context(s) included in the Context\n    Response message.\n\n     The old MME only transfers the EPS Bearer Context(s) that the new SGSN\n    supports. If not supported, EPS Bearer Context(s) of non-IP PDN\n    connection are not transferred to the new SGSN. EPS Bearer Context(s)\n    of Ethernet PDN connection type are not transferred to the new SGSN. If\n    the EPS Bearer Context(s) of a PDN connection has not been transferred,\n    the old MME shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed\n    and release that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN\n    disconnection procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n  5. Security functions may be executed. Procedures are defined in\n    clause\u00a05.3.10 on \"Security Function\".\n\n     For ongoing emergency services only, if the new SGSN is configured to\n    support emergency bearer services in limited service state, it may skip\n    the authentication procedure or proceed even if authentication fails.\n    If the new SGSN does not support emergency bearer services in limited\n    service state, then it rejects the RAU request with an appropriate\n    reject cause.\n\n  6. If the new SGSN identifies that the RAT type has changed, the SGSN\n    checks the subscription information to identify for each APN whether to\n    maintain the PDN connection, disconnect the PDN connection with a\n    reactivation request or disconnect PDN connection without reactivation\n    request. If the SGSN decides to deactive a PDN connection it performs\n    SGSN-initiated PDN Connection Deactivation procedure after tracking\n    area procedure is completed. Existing SM cause values as specified in\n    TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[47] (e.g. #39, \"reactivation requested\"; #66 \"Requested APN\n    not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination\"; and for a dedicated\n    bearer, possibly #37 \"QoS not accepted\") are used to cause predictable\n    UE behaviour.\n\n     The new SGSN determines to relocate the Serving GW. The Serving GW is\n    relocated when the old Serving GW cannot continue to serve the UE. The\n    new SGSN may also decide to relocate the Serving GW if a new Serving GW\n    is expected to serve the UE longer and/or with a more optimal UE to PDN\n    GW path, or if a new Serving GW can be co-located with the PDN GW.\n    Selection of a new Serving GW is performed according to clause\u00a04.3.8.2\n    on \"Serving GW selection function\".\n\n     The new SGSN sends a Context Acknowledge (Serving GW change\n    indication) message to the old MME. Serving GW change indication\n    indicates a new Serving GW has been selected. The old MME marks in its\n    context that the information in the GWs is invalid. This ensures that\n    the old MME updates the GWs if the UE initiates a TAU procedure back to\n    the old MME before completing the ongoing RAU procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Updating the GWs refers to deletion of session(s) on the Serving\n         GW followed by re-creation of session(s) on the Serving GW. The re-\n         creation of session(s) on the Serving GW will result in successful\n         re-establishment of the S5/S8 tunnel between the selected Serving\n         GW and the PDN GW.\n\n     The old MME deletes all bearer resources of the UE when the timer\n    started in step\u00a03 expires.\n\n     If the security functions do not authenticate the UE correctly, then\n    the RAU is rejected, and the new S4\u00a0SGSN sends a reject indication to\n    the old MME. The MME shall continue as if the Identification and\n    Context Request was never received.\n\n     For UE using CIoT EPS Optimisation without any activated PDN\n    connection, the steps 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 17 are skipped.\n\n  7. In this procedure flow the Serving GW is relocated. The SGSN sends a\n    Create Session Request (IMSI, bearer contexts, SGSN Address and TEID\n    for the control plane, RAT Type, Type, the Protocol Type over S5/S8,\n    Serving Network, UE Time Zone, etc) message per PDN connection to the\n    selected new Serving GW. The PDN GW address is indicated in the bearer\n    contexts. Type indicates to the Serving GW to send the Modify Bearer\n    Request to the PDN GW. The Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to\n    Serving GW which protocol should be used over S5/S8 interface. RAT type\n    indicates a change in radio access. As it is a mobility from E-UTRAN,\n    if the target SGSN supports location information change reporting, the\n    target SGSN shall include the User Location Information (according to\n    the supported granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request, regardless of\n    whether location information change reporting had been requested in the\n    previous RAT by the PDN GW. If the PDN GW requested User CSG\n    information, the SGSN also includes the User CSG Information IE in this\n    message.\n\n  8. The new Serving GW sends the message Modify Bearer Request (Serving GW\n    Address, Serving GW TEID, RAT type, Serving Network) per PDN connection\n    to the PDN GW concerned. User Location Information IE and/or UE Time\n    Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE are also included if they are\n    present in step\u00a07.\n\n  9. If dynamic PCC is deployed, and RAT type information or UE location\n    information or UE Time Zone needs to be conveyed from the PDN GW to the\n    PCRF, then the PDN GW shall send this information to the PCRF by means\n    of an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The PDN GW does not need to wait for the PCRF response, but\n         continues in the next step. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS\n         bearer modification the PDN GW should initiate a bearer update\n         procedure.\n\n  10.  The PDN GW updates its context field and returns a Modify Bearer\n    Response (Charging Id, MSISDN) message to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is\n    included if the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. If location\n    information change reporting is required and supported in the target\n    SGSN, the PDN GW shall provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in the\n    Modify Bearer Response.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path.\n    If the source Serving GW has no downlink user plane established, the\n    Serving GW shall discard the \"end marker\" received from the PDN GW and\n    shall not send Downlink Data Notification. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the source eNodeB.\n\n  11.  The new Serving GW updates its bearer context. This allows the\n    Serving GW to route Bearer PDUs to the PDN GW when received from RNC.\n    The new Serving GW returns a Create Session Response (Serving GW\n    address and TEID, PDN GW Address and TEIDs (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE\n    keys (for PMIP-based S5/S8, MS Info Change Reporting Action) at the PDN\n    GW(s) for uplink traffic) message to the SGSN.\n\n     When the SGSN receives the Create Session Response message, the SGSN\n    checks if there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event\n    or a \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the\n    SGSN and in such a case sends an event notification (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]\n    for further information).\n\n  12.  The new SGSN verifies whether it holds subscription data for the UE\n    identified by the P-TMSI, the additional P-TMSI/RAI or by the IMSI\n    received with the context data from the old CN node.\n\n     The additional P-TMSI/RAI allows the new SGSN to find any already\n    existing UE context stored in the new SGSN. If there are no\n    subscription data in the new SGSN for this UE, or for some network\n    sharing scenario (e.g. GWCN) if the PLMN-ID of the RAI supplied by the\n    RNC is different from that of the RAI in the UE's context, then the new\n    SGSN informs the HSS of the change of SGSN by sending an Update\n    Location (SGSN Number, SGSN Address, IMSI, Homogenous Support of IMS\n    Voice over PS Session, UE SRVCC capability, equivalent PLMN list)\n    message to the HSS. For \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS\n    Sessions\", see clause\u00a05.3.8A of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. The inclusion of the\n    equivalent PLMN list indicates that the SGSN supports the inter-PLMN\n    handover to a CSG cell in an equivalent PLMN using the subscription\n    information of the target PLMN.\n\n     If the UE initiates the RAU procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous\n    CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the\n    VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and the SGSN needs to retrieve the\n    CSG subscription information of the UE from the CSS, the SGSN initiates\n    the Update CSG Location Procedure with CSS as described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.12.\n\n  13.  The HSS sends a Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) message to\n    the old SGSN with the Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure.\n\n     When receiving the Cancel Location message the old SGSN removes all\n    the UE contexts. The old SGSN acknowledges with a Cancel Location Ack\n    (IMSI) message.\n\n  14.  When receiving the Context Acknowledge message from the new S4 SGSN\n    and if the old MME has an S1-MME association for the UE, the source MME\n    sends a S1-U Release Command to the source eNodeB after the timer\n    started in step3 has expired. The RRC connection is released by the\n    source eNodeB. The source eNodeB confirms the release of the RRC\n    connection and of the S1-U connection by sending a S1-U Release\n    Complete message to the source MME.\n\n  15.  The HSS acknowledges the Update Location message by sending an\n    Update Location Ack (IMSI, Subscription Data) to the new SGSN. If the\n    Update Location is rejected by the HSS, the new SGSN rejects the RAU\n    Request from the UE with an appropriate cause. In such cases, the SGSN\n    releases any local SGSN EPS Bearer contexts for this particular UE, and\n    additionally deletes the EPS bearer resources in the new Serving GW by\n    sending the Delete Session Request (Cause, Operation Indication)\n    messages to the new Serving GW. The Operation Indication flag shall not\n    be set. Therefore, the new Serving GW receiving this request shall not\n    initiate a delete procedure towards the PDN GW.\n\n     The new SGSN validates the UE's presence in the (new) RA. If due to\n    regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions (e.g. CSG\n    restrictions) the UE is not allowed to be attached in the RA, the SGSN\n    rejects the Routing Area Update Request with an appropriate cause to\n    the UE and notifies the HSS of the rejection. The Subscription Data may\n    contain the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and for the\n    equivalent PLMN list requested by SGSN in step\u00a012.\n\n     If the UE initiates the RAU procedure at a CSG cell, the new S4 SGSN\n    shall check whether the CSG ID and associated PLMN is contained in the\n    CSG subscription and is not expired. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN\n    is not present or expired, the S4 SGSN shall send a RAU reject message\n    to the UE with an appropriate cause value. The UE shall remove the CSG\n    ID and associated PLMN from its Allowed CSG list if present.\n\n  16.  When the timer started in step\u00a03 expires and the old MME received\n    the Serving GW change indication in the Context Acknowledge message,\n    the old MME deletes the EPS bearer resources by sending Delete Session\n    Request (Cause, Operation Indication) messages to the old Serving GW.\n    The operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to the old\n    Serving GW that the old Serving GW shall not initiate a delete\n    procedure towards the PDN GW. If ISR is activated the cause indicates\n    to the old S-GW that the old S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on\n    the other old CN node by sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to\n    that CN node.\n\n  17.  The old Serving GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause)\n    messages. The old Serving GW discards any packets buffered for the UE.\n\n  18.  If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions\n    the UE is not allowed to access the RA:\n\n  -  For UEs with ongoing emergency bearer services, the new SGSN accept\n    the Routing Area Update Request and deactivates the non-emergency PDP\n    contexts as specified in clause\u00a09.2.4.2 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. If the\n    Routing Area Update procedure is initiated in PMM-IDLE/STANDBY state,\n    all non-emergency PDP Contexts are deactivated by the Routing Area\n    Update procedure without PDP Context deactivation signalling between\n    the UE and the SGSN.\n\n  -  For all other cases, the new SGSN rejects Routing Area Update Request\n    with an appropriate cause to the UE and notifies the HSS of rejection\n    (details of this notification is specified in stage\u00a03).\n\n     The new SGSN responds to the UE with a Routing Area Update Accept (P-\n    TMSI, P-TMSI Signature, Emergency Service Support indicator, PDP\n    context status) message. The Emergency Service Support indicator\n    informs the UE that Emergency bearer services are supported over UTRAN.\n\n     For an S-GW change ISR Activated is never indicated by the SGSN to the\n    UE as it needs a TAU with the same S-GW first to activate ISR. For an\n    SGSN change ISR is not activated by the new SGSN to avoid context\n    transfer procedures with two old CN nodes.\n\n     When receiving the RAU Accept message, as there is no ISR Activated\n    indication, the UE shall set its TIN to \"P-TMSI\".\n\n     In Iu mode, if after step\u00a07 the new SGSN receives a Downlink Data\n    Notification message or any other downlink signalling message while the\n    UE is still connected, the new SGSN may prolong the PS signalling\n    connection with the UE.\n\n     If there is DL data buffered for a UE using power saving functions\n    (i.e. the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the UE\n    in the SGSN has not expired), the user plane setup is performed in\n    conjunction with the RAU Accept message.\n\n     If the RAU procedure is initiated by manual CSG selection and occurs\n    via a CSG cell, the UE upon receiving the RAU Accept message shall add\n    the CSG ID and associated PLMN to its Allowed CSG list if it is not\n    already present. Manual CSG selection is not supported if the UE has\n    emergency bearers established.\n\n     With the PDP context status information, the UE shall deactivate all\n    those bearers contexts locally which are active in the UE, but are\n    indicated by the SGSN as being inactive.\n\n     If the user plane setup is performed in conjunction with the RAU\n    Accept message and the RAU is performed via a hybrid cell, then the\n    SGSN shall send an indication whether the UE is a CSG member to the RAN\n    along with the RANAP message. Based on this information the RAN may\n    perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG members.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  If the UE receives a RAU Accept message via a hybrid cell, the\n         UE does not add the corresponding CSG ID and associated PLMN to its\n         Allowed CSG list. Adding a CSG ID and associated PLMN to the UE's\n         local Allowed CSG list for a hybrid cell is performed only by OTA\n         or OMA DM procedures.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  When ISR Activated is indicated and the UE's TIN indicates \"P-\n         TMSI\" the TIN is not changed. When ISR Activated is indicated and\n         the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\" or \"RAT-related TMSI\" the UE shall\n         set its TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\".\n\n  19.  If the P-TMSI was included in the RAU Accept message, the UE\n    acknowledges the new P-TMSI by returning a Routing Area Update Complete\n    message to the SGSN.\n\n  20.  For Iu-mode, if the UE has uplink data or signalling pending it\n    shall send a Service Request (P-TMSI, CKSN, Service Type) message to\n    the new SGSN. If a P-TMSI was allocated in step 18, that P-TMSI is the\n    one included in this message. Service Type specifies the requested\n    service. Service Type shall indicate one of the following: Data or\n    Signalling.\n\n  21.  If the UE has sent the Service Request, the new 3G SGSN requests the\n    RNC to establish a radio access bearer by sending a RAB Assignment\n    Request (RAB ID(s), QoS Profile(s), GTP SNDs, GTP SNUs, PDCP SNUs)\n    message to the RNC. If Direct Tunnel is established the SGSN provides\n    to the RNC the Serving GW's Address for User Plane and TEID for uplink\n    data.\n\n  22.  If the SGSN established Direct Tunnel in step 21) it shall send\n    Modify Bearer Request to the Serving GW and include the RNC's Address\n    for User Plane and downlink TEID for data. The Serving GW updates the\n    Address for User Plane and TEID for downlink data and return a Modify\n    Bearer Response.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  EPS does not support any CAMEL procedures.\n\nIn the case of a rejected routing area update operation, due to regional\nsubscription, roaming restrictions, access restrictions (see TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[27]\nand TS\u00a023.008\u00a0[28]) or because the SGSN cannot determine the HLR address to\nestablish the locating updating dialogue, the new SGSN should not construct\nan MM context. In the case of receiving the subscriber data from HLR, the\nnew SGSN may construct an MM context and store the subscriber data for the\nUE to optimise signalling between the SGSN and the HSS. A reject shall be\nreturned to the UE with an appropriate cause and the PS signalling\nconnection shall be released. Upon return to idle, the UE shall act\naccording to TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[10].\n\nIf the new SGSN is unable to update the bearer context in one or more P-\nGWs, the new SGSN shall deactivate the corresponding bearer contexts as\ndescribed in clause \"SGSN-initiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure\" of\nTS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. This shall not cause the SGSN to reject the routing area\nupdate.\n\nThe new SGSN shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on the\nreceived APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Context Response\nmessage and then store the new Maximum APN restriction value.\n\nThe PDP contexts shall be prioritized by the new SGSN. If the new SGSN is\nunable to support the same number of active PDP contexts as received from\nold MME, the prioritisation is used to decide which PDP contexts to\nmaintain active and which ones to delete. In any case, the new SGSN shall\nfirst update all PDP contexts in one or more P-GWs and then deactivate the\nPDP context(s) that it cannot maintain as described in clause \"SGSN-\ninitiated PDP Context Deactivation Procedure\" of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. This shall\nnot cause the SGSN to reject the routing area update.\n\nIf the routing area update procedure fails a maximum allowable number of\ntimes, or if the SGSN returns a Routing Area Update Reject (Cause) message,\nthe MS shall enter IDLE state.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Service Request procedures", "numbering": "5.3.4", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.3.4  Service Request procedures\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UE triggered Service Request", "numbering": "5.3.4.1", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.4.1  UE triggered Service Request\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n          Figure 5.3.4.1-1: UE triggered Service Request procedure\n\nThe Service Request procedure in this clause\u00a0is triggered by the UE in ECM-\nIDLE status to establish user plane radio bearers for the UE.\n\nThe UE in ECM-IDLE state can also use this procedure to establish user\nplane radio bearers even if the UE applies Control Plane CIoT EPS\nOptimisation, when the UE and MME supports S1-U data transfer or User Plane\nEPS Optimisation in addition to Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2]. Steps\u00a09 and 11 concern GTP-based S5/S8.\n\n  1. The UE sends NAS message Service Request towards the MME encapsulated\n    in an RRC message to the eNodeB. The RRC message(s) that can be used to\n    carry the S-TMSI and this NAS message are described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  2. The eNodeB forwards NAS message to MME. NAS message is encapsulated in\n    an S1-AP: Initial UE Message (NAS message, TAI+ECGI of the serving\n    cell, S-TMSI, CSG ID, CSG access Mode, RRC establishment cause).\n    Details of this step are described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. If the MME can't\n    handle the Service Request it will reject it. CSG ID is provided if the\n    UE sends the Service Request message via a CSG cell or a hybrid cell.\n    CSG access mode is provided if the UE sends the Service Request message\n    via a hybrid cell. If the CSG access mode is not provided but the CSG\n    ID is provided, the MME shall consider the cell as a CSG cell.\n\n     If a CSG ID is indicated and CSG access mode is not provided, and\n    there is no subscription data for this CSG ID and associated PLMN or\n    the CSG subscription is expired, the MME rejects the Service Request\n    with an appropriate cause. The UE shall remove the CSG ID and\n    associated PLMN of the cell where the UE has initiated the service\n    request procedure from the Allowed CSG list, if present.\n\n     For UEs with emergency EPS bearers, i.e. at least one EPS bearer has\n    an ARP value reserved for emergency services, if CSG access\n    restrictions do not allow the UE to get normal services the MME shall\n    deactivate all non-emergency bearers and accept the Service Request.\n\n     If LIPA is active for a PDN connection and if the cell accessed by the\n    UE does not link to the L-GW where the UE inititiated the LIPA PDN\n    Connection, the MME shall not request the establishment of the bearers\n    of the LIPA PDN connection from the eNodeB in step\u00a04 and shall request\n    disconnection of the LIPA PDN connection according to clause\u00a05.10.3. If\n    the UE has no other PDN connection then the MME shall reject the\n    Service Request with an appropriate cause value resulting in the UE\n    detaching, skip the following steps of the procedure and initiate the\n    release of the core network resources with the implicit MME-initiated\n    Detach procedure according to clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n     If there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event or a\n    \"UE Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the MME,\n    the MME sends an event notification (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] for further\n    information).\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB indicates the UE's Coverage Level\n    to the MME.\n\n  3. NAS authentication/security procedures as defined in clause\u00a05.3.10 on\n    \"Security function\" may be performed.\n\n     If the MME is configured to support RLOS and the UE indicated Attach\n    Type \"RLOS\", based on local regulation and operator policy, the MME may\n    skip the authentication and security setup, or the MME may perform\n    authentication if security information is available or obtainable from\n    a HSS, and continue the Service Request procedure regardless of the\n    authentication result.\n\n  4. If there is a Service Gap timer running in the MME MM Context for the\n    UE and the MME is not waiting for a MT paging response from the UE, the\n    MME rejects the Service Request with an appropriate cause. In addition,\n    MME may also provide a UE with a Mobility Management Back-off timer set\n    to the remaining value of the Service Gap timer.\n\n     The MME deletes S11-U related information in UE context if there is\n    any, including TEID(DL) for the S11-U for Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation if data buffering is in the MME, ROHC context for Control\n    Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, etc, but not the Header Compression\n    Configuration. The MME sends S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request\n    (Serving GW address, S1-TEID(s) (UL), EPS Bearer QoS(s), Security\n    Context, MME Signalling Connection Id, Handover Restriction List, CSG\n    Membership Indication) message to the eNodeB. If there is a PDN\n    connection established for Local IP Access, this message includes a\n    Correlation ID for enabling the direct user plane path between the HeNB\n    and the L-GW. If there is a PDN connection established for SIPTO at the\n    Local Network with L-GW function collocated with the (H)eNB, this\n    message includes a SIPTO Correlation ID for enabling the direct user\n    plane path between the (H)eNB and the L-GW. This step activates the\n    radio and S1 bearers for all the active EPS Bearers. The eNodeB stores\n    the Security Context, MME Signalling Connection Id, EPS Bearer QoS(s)\n    and S1-TEID(s) in the UE RAN context. The step is described in detail\n    in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. Handover Restriction List is described in clause\n    4.3.5.7 \"Mobility Restrictions\".\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  In this release of the 3GPP specification the Correlation ID and\n         SIPTO Correlation ID is set equal to the user plane PDN GW TEID\n         (GTP-based S5) or GRE key (PMIP-based S5) which is specified in\n         clause\u00a05.3.2.1 and clause\u00a05.10.2.\n\n     If the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced\n    Coverage, the MME sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter to the\n    eNB in the S1-AP message.\n\n     The MME shall only request to establish Emergency EPS Bearer if the UE\n    is not allowed to access the cell where the UE initiated the service\n    request procedure due to CSG access restriction.\n\n     If the Service Request is performed via a hybrid cell, CSG Membership\n    Indication indicating whether the UE is a CSG member shall be included\n    in the S1-AP message from the MME to the RAN. Based on this information\n    the RAN can perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG\n    members.\n\n     If RACS is supported and MME has UE Radio Capability ID in UE context,\n    it signals the UE Radio Capability ID to the eNB as defined in\n    clause\u00a05.11.3a. If the eNB does not have mapping between the specific\n    UE Radio Capability ID and the UE radio capabilities, it shall use the\n    procedure described in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36] to retrieve the mapping from the\n    Core Network.\n\n  5. The eNodeB performs the radio bearer establishment procedure. The user\n    plane security is established at this step, which is described in\n    detail in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. When the user plane radio bearers are setup.\n    EPS bearer state synchronization is performed between the UE and the\n    network, i.e. the UE shall locally remove any EPS bearer for which no\n    radio bearers are setup and, if the radio bearer for a default EPS\n    bearer is not established, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS\n    bearers associated to that default EPS bearer.\n\n  6. The uplink data from the UE can now be forwarded by eNodeB to the\n    Serving GW. The eNodeB sends the uplink data to the Serving GW address\n    and TEID provided in the step 4. The Serving GW forwards the uplink\n    data to the PDN\u00a0GW.\n\n  7. The eNodeB sends an S1-AP message Initial Context Setup Complete\n    (eNodeB address, List of accepted EPS bearers, List of rejected EPS\n    bearers, S1 TEID(s) (DL)) to the MME. This step is described in detail\n    in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. If the Correlation ID or SIPTO Correlation ID is\n    included in step\u00a04, the eNodeB shall use the included information to\n    establish a direct user plane path to the L-GW and forward uplink data\n    for Local IP Access or SIPTO at the Local Network with L-GW function\n    collocated with the (H)eNB accordingly.\n\n  8. The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request message (eNodeB address, S1\n    TEID(s) (DL) for the accepted EPS bearers, Delay Downlink Packet\n    Notification Request, RAT Type, MO Exception data counter) per PDN\n    connection to the Serving GW. If the Serving GW supports Modify Access\n    Bearers Request procedure and if there is no need for the Serving GW to\n    send the signalling to the PDN GW, the MME may send Modify Access\n    Bearers Request (eNodeB address(es) and TEIDs for downlink user plane\n    for the accepted EPS bearers, Delay Downlink Packet Notification\n    Request) per UE to the Serving GW to optimise the signalling. The\n    Serving GW is now able to transmit downlink data towards the UE. The\n    usage of the Delay Downlink Packet Notification Request Information\n    Element is specified in clause 5.3.4.2 below. If the PDN GW requested\n    UE's location and/or User CSG information and the UE's location and/or\n    User CSG information has changed, the MME also includes the User\n    Location Information IE and/or User CSG Information IE in this message.\n    If ISR is activated or if the Serving Network IE has changed compared\n    to the last reported Serving Network IE then the MME also includes the\n    Serving Network IE in this message. If the UE Time Zone has changed\n    compared to the last reported UE Time Zone then the MME shall include\n    the UE Time Zone IE in this message. If the internal flag Pending\n    Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling is set, the MME indicates\n    UE available for end to end signalling in the Modify Bearer Request\n    message and reset the flag.\n\n     The MME only includes the MO Exception data counter if the RRC\n    establishment cause is set to \"MO exception data\" and the UE is\n    accessing via the NB-IoT RAT. The MME maintains the MO Exception Data\n    Counter for Serving PLMN Rate Control purposes (see clause\u00a04.7.7.2).\n    The MME may immediately send the MO Exception Data Counter to the\n    Serving GW. Alternatively, in order to reduce signalling, the MME may\n    send the MO Exception Data Counter to the Serving GW as described in\n    TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43].\n\n     The MME and the Serving GW clears the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time\n    in their UE contexts if it was set, to remember that any DL data\n    buffered for a UE using power saving functions has been delivered and\n    to avoid any unnecessary user plane setup in conjunction with a later\n    TAU.\n\n     If a default EPS bearer is not accepted by the eNodeB, all the EPS\n    bearers associated to that default bearer shall be treated as non-\n    accepted bearers. The MME releases the non-accepted bearers by\n    triggering the bearer release procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2.\n    If the Serving GW receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the\n    Serving GW drops the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data\n    Notification to the MME.\n\n  9. If the RAT Type has changed compared to the last reported RAT Type or\n    if the UE's Location and/or Info IEs and/or UE Time Zone and/or if ISR\n    is not activated and Serving Network id and/or the indication UE\n    available for end to end signalling are present in step\u00a08, the Serving\n    GW shall send the Modify Bearer Request message (RAT Type, MO Exception\n    data counter) per PDN connection to the PDN GW. User Location\n    Information IE and/or User CSG Information IE and/or Serving Network IE\n    and/or UE Time Zone and/or the indication UE available for end to end\n    signalling are also included if they are present in step\u00a08.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons and the PDN GW charging is paused, then the SGW shall send a\n    Modify Bearer Request message with PDN Charging Pause Stop Indication\n    to inform the PDN GW that the charging is no longer paused. Other IEs\n    are not included in this message.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons but the MME indicated the MO Exception data counter, then the\n    Serving Gateway should notify the PDN GW that this RRC establishment\n    cause has been used by the MO Exception Data Counter (see\n    TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43]). The Serving GW indicates each use of this RRC\n    establishment cause by the related counter on its CDR.\n\n  10.  If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW interacts with the PCRF to\n    get the PCC rule(s) according to the RAT Type by means of a PCEF\n    initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6]. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply\n    local QoS policy.\n\n     The PDN GW indicates each use of the RRC establishment cause \"MO\n    Exception Data\" by the related counter on its CDR.\n\n  11.  The PDN GW sends the Modify Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n\n  12.  The Serving GW shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW\n    address and TEID for uplink traffic) to the MME as a response to a\n    Modify Bearer Request message, or a Modify Access Bearers Response\n    (Serving GW address and TEID for uplink traffic) as a response to a\n    Modify Access Bearers Request message. If the Serving GW cannot serve\n    the MME Request in the Modify Access Bearers Request message without\n    S5/S8 signalling other than to unpause charging in the PDN GW or\n    without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8\n    interface, it shall respond to the MME with indicating that the\n    modifications are not limited to S1-U bearers, and the MME shall repeat\n    its request using a Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection with\n    stand-alone GW deployment and the Local Home Network ID for stand-alone\n    accessed by the UE differs from the Local Home Network ID where the UE\n    initiated the SIPTO@LN PDN Connection, the MME shall request\n    disconnection of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection(s) with\n    the \"reactivation requested\" cause value according to clause\u00a05.10.3. If\n    the UE has no other PDN connection, the MME initiated \"explicit detach\n    with reattach required\" procedure according to clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection with\n    collocated LGW deployement and the L-GW CN address of the cell accessed\n    by the UE differs from the L-GW CN address of the cell where the UE\n    initiated the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN Connection, the MME shall\n    request disconnection of the SIPTO at the local network PDN\n    connection(s) with the \"reactivation requested\" cause value according\n    to clause\u00a05.10.3. If the UE has no other PDN connection, the MME\n    initiated \"explicit detach with reattach required\" procedure according\n    to clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Handling of abnormal conditions in UE triggered Service Request", "numbering": "5.3.4.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.4.2  Handling of abnormal conditions in UE triggered Service Request\n\nUnder certain conditions, the current UE triggered Service Request\nprocedure can cause unnecessary Downlink Packet Notification messages which\nincrease the load of the MME.\n\nThis can occur when uplink data sent in step 6 causes a response on the\ndownlink which arrives at the Serving GW before the Modify Bearer Request\nmessage, step 8. This data cannot be forwarded from the Serving GW to the\neNodeB and hence it triggers a Downlink Data Notification message.\n\nIf the MME receives a Downlink Data Notification after step 2 and before\nstep 9, the MME shall not send S1 interface paging messages. However,\nacross all the UEs on that MME, the MME shall monitor the rate at which\nthese events occur.

The Serving GW then uses this delay in\nbetween receiving downlink data and sending the Downlink Data Notification\nmessage.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  A low rate of reception of Downlink Data Notifications between\n         steps 2 and 9 should be considered a normal circumstance, e.g. due\n         to the chance that a UE Terminating call/session is initiated at\n         roughly the same time as the UE triggered Service Request\n         procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  It is recommended that this rate is determined over 60\u00a0second\n         periods.\n\nThe MME shall use the step 8 Modify Access Bearers Request or Modify Bearer\nRequest of the UE initiated Service Request procedure to indicate \"Delay\nDownlink Packet Notification Request\" to the Serving GW.\n\nTo determine the amount of delay requested by a given MME, the Serving GW\neither uses the last Modify Access Bearers Request or Modify Bearer Request\nmessage which is part of a Service Request procedure, or, just uses one of\nthe Service Request procedure's Modify Access Bearers Request or Modify\nBearer Request messages received within the preceding 30\u00a0seconds. The\nlatter mode of operation shall be taken into account when implementing the\nMME.\n\nThe MME is responsible for setting the value of D. The exact algorithm for\nsetting the value is implementation dependent, two examples are given below\nto serve as a guideline:\n\n  EXAMPLE 1:  The MME adaptively increases the value of D when the rate of\n             unnecessary Downlink Data Notifications is too high; and\n             correspondingly it decreases the value when the rate is not\n             too high.\n\n  EXAMPLE 2:  When unnecessary Downlink Data Notifications arrive, the MME\n             measures the average time from the reception of the\n             unnecessary Downlink Data Notification to the reception of the\n             Modify Access Bearers Request or Modify Bearer Response from\n             the Serving GW in the same UE triggered Service Request\n             Procedure. The value of D is calculated from this average, by\n             adding a safety margin.\n\nNormally, upon receipt of a downlink data packet for which there is no DL-\nTEID of the S1 user plane tunnel, the S-GW shall send the Downlink Data\nNotification message to the MME without delay.\n\nIf the S-GW determines from the last Modify Access Bearers Request or\nModify Bearer Request message which is part of a Service Request procedure\nthat a given MME request delaying of the Downlink Packet Notification by a\ndelay of D, it shall (only for UEs of that MME) buffer the Downlink Data\nfor a period D. If the DL-TEID and eNodeB address for the UE is received\nbefore the expiry of the timer, the timer shall be cancelled and the\nNetwork triggered Service Request procedure is finished without sending the\nDownlink Data Notification message to the MME, i.e. DL data are sent to the\nUE. Otherwise the Downlink Data Notification message is sent to the MME\nwhen the timer expires.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The above procedure and indicated time values are intended to\n         ensure that the procedure is \"stable\"; avoids RAN impacts; and,\n         that the negative impacts of shortening the DRX interval on UE\n         battery life are avoided.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Network Triggered Service Request", "numbering": "5.3.4.3", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.3.4.3  Network Triggered Service Request\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n        Figure 5.3.4.3-1: Network triggered Service Request procedure\n\nIf the MME needs to signal with the UE that is in ECM-IDLE state, e.g. to\nperform the MME/HSS-initiated detach procedure for the ECM-IDLE mode UE or\nthe S-GW receives control signalling (e.g. Create Bearer Request or Update\nBearer Request), the MME starts network triggered service request procedure\nfrom step 3a in the Network Triggered Service request procedure.\n\nIf the MME wishes to use the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation for mobile\nterminating services, then the procedure of clause\u00a05.3.4B.3 is used to\nreplace the procedure of this clause.\n\nIf ISR is activated, when the Serving GW receives a Create Bearer Request\nor Update Bearer Request for a UE, and the S-GW does not have a downlink S1-\nU and the SGSN has notified the Serving GW that the UE has moved to PMM-\nIDLE or STANDBY state, the Serving GW buffers signalling messages and sends\na Downlink Data Notification to trigger the MME and SGSN to page the UE. If\nthe Serving GW, while waiting for the user plane to be established, is\ntriggered to send a second Downlink Data Notification with higher priority\n(i.e. ARP priority level) than the first Downlink Data Notification was\nsent with, the Serving GW sends a new Downlink Data Notification message\nindicating the higher priority to the MME. If the Serving GW receives\nadditional downlink signalling messages for a bearer with same or lower\npriority than the first Downlink Data Notification was sent for or if the\nServing GW has sent the second Downlink Data Notification message\nindicating the higher priority and receives additional downlink signalling\nmessages for this UE, the Serving GW buffers these downlink signalling\nmessages and does not send a new Downlink Data Notification. The S-GW will\nbe notified about the current RAT type based on the UE triggered service\nrequest procedure. The S-GW will go on executing the dedicated bearer\nactivation or dedicated bearer modification procedure, i.e. send the\ncorresponding buffered signalling to MME or SGSN which UE resides in now\nand inform the current RAT type to the PDN GW if the RAT type has been\nchanged compared to the last reported RAT Type. If dynamic PCC is deployed,\nthe current RAT type information shall also be conveyed from the PDN GW to\nthe PCRF. If the PCRF response leads to an EPS bearer modification the PDN\nGW should initiate a bearer update procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.2.1\nbelow.\n\nWhen the Serving GW sends a Downlink Data Notification, it shall include\nboth EPS Bearer ID and ARP. If the Downlink Data Notification is triggered\nby the arrival of downlink data packets at the Serving GW, the Serving GW\nshall include the EPS Bearer ID and ARP associated with the bearer on which\nthe downlink data packet was received. If the Downlink Data Notification is\ntriggered by the arrival of control signalling, the Serving GW shall\ninclude the EPS Bearer ID and ARP if present in the control signalling. If\nthe ARP is not present in the control signalling, the Serving GW shall\ninclude the ARP in the stored EPS bearer context.\n\nIf a LIPA PDN connection exists, when the L-GW receives the downlink data\nfor a UE that is in ECM-IDLE state, the L-GW sends the first downlink user\npacket to Serving GW and buffers all other downlink user packets. The\nServing GW will trigger the MME to page the UE.\n\n  1. When the Serving GW receives a downlink data packet/control signalling\n    for a UE known as not user plane connected (i.e. the S-GW context data\n    indicates no downlink user plane TEID), it buffers the downlink data\n    packet and identifies which MME or SGSN is serving that UE.\n\n     If that MME has requested the Serving GW to throttle downlink low\n    priority traffic and if the downlink data packet is received on a low\n    priority bearer to be throttled (see clause\u00a04.3.7.4.1a), the SGW drops\n    the downlink data. The steps below are not executed.\n\n     If that MME has requested the S-GW to delay sending the Downlink Data\n    Notification (see clause 5.3.4.2 on \"Handling of abnormal conditions in\n    UE triggered Service Request\"), the Serving GW buffers the downlink\n    data and waits until the timer expires before continuing with step 2.\n    If the DL-TEID and eNodeB address for that UE is received before the\n    expiry of the timer, the timer shall be cancelled and the Network\n    triggered Service Request procedure is finished without executing the\n    steps below, i.e. DL data are sent to the UE.\n\n     If the Serving GW receives additional downlink data packets/control\n    signalling for this UE before the expiry of the timer, the Serving GW\n    does not restart this timer.\n\n  2. The Serving GW sends a Downlink Data Notification message (ARP, EPS\n    Bearer ID, Paging Policy Indication) to the MME and SGSN nodes for\n    which it has control plane connectivity for the given UE. The ARP and\n    EPS Bearer ID are always set in Downlink Data Notification. The MME and\n    SGSN respond to the S-GW with a Downlink Data Notification Ack message.\n    When supporting Paging Policy Differentiation, the Serving GW indicates\n    in the message the Paging Policy Indication related to the downlink\n    data that triggered the Downlink Data Notification message, as\n    described in clause\u00a04.9.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The ARP, the EPS Bearer ID and optionally the Paging Policy\n         Indication are sent to the SGSN as well as MME, but the usage of\n         these parameters at SGSN is not specified in this release of the\n         specification.\n\n     An MME and an SGSN that detects that the UE is in a power saving state\n    (e.g. Power Saving Mode or extended idle mode DRX) and cannot be\n    reached by paging at the moment, shall invoke extended buffering\n    depending on operator configuration, except for cases described in next\n    paragraphs. MME/SGSN derives the expected time before radio bearers can\n    be established to the UE. The MME/SGSN then indicates DL Buffering\n    Requested to the Serving GW in the Downlink Data Notification Ack\n    message and includes a DL Buffering Duration time and optionally a DL\n    Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The MME/SGSN stores a new value for\n    the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the UE based\n    on the DL Buffering Duration time and skips the remaining steps of this\n    procedure. The DL Data Buffer Expiration Time is used for UEs using\n    power saving state and indicates that there are buffered data in the\n    Serving GW and that the user plane setup procedure is needed when the\n    UE makes signalling with the network. When the DL Data Buffer\n    Expiration Time has expired, the MME/SGSN considers no DL data to be\n    buffered and no indications of Buffered DL Data Waiting are sent during\n    context transfers at TAU procedures.\n\n     If there is a \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event\n    configured for the UE in the MME/SGSN, the MME/SGSN does not invoke\n    extended buffering. Instead, the MME/SGSN sets the Notify-on-available-\n    after-DDN-failure flag to remember to send an \"Availability after DDN\n    Failure\" notification when the UE becomes available. If there is a \"UE\n    Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the MME/SGSN,\n    the MME/SGSN should not need to invoke extended buffering.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  When \"Availability after DDN failure\" and \"UE reachability\"\n         monitoring events are used for a UE, the application server is\n         assumed to send data when the UE is reachable or about to become\n         reachable, hence no extended buffering is needed. If there are\n         multiple application servers, the event notifications and extended\n         buffering may be needed simultaneously. It is assumed this is\n         handled through additional information based on SLA as described in\n         the next paragraph.\n\n     The MME/SGSN may use additional information based on a SLA with the\n    MTC user for when to invoke extended buffering, e.g. only invoke it for\n    a certain APN, do not invoke it for certain subscribers, invoke\n    extended buffering in conjunction with \"Availability after DDN failure\"\n    and \"UE reachability\" monitoring events, etc.\n\n     A Serving GW that receives a DL Buffering Requested indication in a\n    Downlink Data Notification Ack message stores a new value for the DL\n    Data Buffer Expiration Time based on the DL Buffering Duration time and\n    does not send any additional Downlink Data Notification if subsequent\n    downlink data packets are received in the Serving GW before the buffer\n    time DL Data Buffer Expiration Time has expired for the UE.\n\n     If the Serving GW, while waiting for the user plane to be established,\n    is triggered to send a second Downlink Data Notification for a bearer\n    with higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level) than the first Downlink\n    Data Notification was sent for, the SGW sends a new Downlink Data\n    Notification message indicating the higher priority to the MME. If the\n    Serving GW receives additional downlink data packets for a bearer with\n    same or lower priority than the first Downlink Data Notification was\n    sent for or if the Serving GW has sent the second Downlink Data\n    Notification message indicating the higher priority and receives\n    additional downlink data packets for this UE, the Serving GW buffers\n    these downlink data packets and does not send a new Downlink Data\n    Notification.\n\n     If the Serving GW, while waiting for the user plane to be established,\n    receives a Modify Bearer Request message from MME or SGSN other than\n    the one it sent a Downlink Data Notification message to, the Serving GW\n    re-sends the Downlink Data Notification message only to the new MME or\n    SGSN from which it received the Modify Bearer Request message even if\n    ISR is active.\n\n     If the Tracking Area Update procedure with MME change or the Routing\n    Area Update procedure is in progress when the old MME receives a\n    Downlink Data Notification message, the old MME may reject a Downlink\n    Data Notification message with an indication that the Downlink Data\n    Notification message has been temporarily rejected.\n\n     Similarly, if the Routing Area Update procedure with SGSN change or\n    the Tracking Area Update procedure is in progress when the old SGSN\n    receives a Downlink Data Notification message, the old SGSN may reject\n    a Downlink Data Notification message with an indication that the\n    Downlink Data Notification message has been temporarily rejected.\n\n     Upon reception of a Downlink Data Notification Ack message with an\n    indication that the Downlink Data Notification message has been\n    temporarily rejected and if the Downlink Data Notification is triggered\n    by the arrival of downlink data packets at the Serving GW, the Serving\n    GW may start a locally configured guard timer and buffers all downlink\n    user packets received to the given UE and waits for a Modify Bearer\n    Request message to come. Upon reception of a Modify Bearer Request\n    message, the Serving GW re-sends the Downlink Data Notification message\n    only to the new MME or SGSN from which it received the Modify Bearer\n    Request message even if ISR is active. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    releases buffered downlink user packets at expiry of the guard timer or\n    receiving the Delete Session Request message from MME/SGSN.\n\n     Upon reception of a Downlink Data Notification Ack message with an\n    indication that the Downlink Data Notification message has been\n    temporarily rejected and if the Downlink Data Notification is triggered\n    by the arrival of signalling messages at the Serving GW, the Serving GW\n    may reject the PDN GW initiated EPS bearer(s) request with the same\n    indication that the request has been temporarily rejected. Upon\n    reception of a rejection for an EPS bearer(s) PDN GW initiated\n    procedure with an indication that the request has been temporarily\n    rejected, the PDN GW may start a locally configured guard timer. The\n    PDN GW may re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when\n    either it detects the UE accesses via a new SGW or at expiry of the\n    guard timer.\n\n  3a.  If the UE is registered in the MME and considered reachable for\n    paging, the MME sends a Paging message (NAS ID for paging, TAI(s), UE\n    identity based DRX index, Paging DRX length, list of CSG IDs for\n    paging, Paging Priority indication, Enhanced Coverage Restricted, CE\n    mode B Restricted) to each eNodeB belonging to the tracking area(s) in\n    which the UE is registered. The step is described in detail in\n    TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] and TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]. Steps 3-4 are omitted if the MME\n    already has a signalling connection over S1-MME towards the UE but the\n    S1-U tunnel has not yet been established.\n\n     If extended idle mode DRX is enabled for the UE, the MME pages the UE\n    just before the occurrence of the UE's next paging occasion, which is\n    determined as described in TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74].\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  Steps 3a and 4a are performed also when the UE and the network\n         support User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and the previous RRC\n         connection has been suspended.\n\n     Paging priority indication is included only:\n\n    -  if the MME receives a Downlink Data Notification or Create Bearer\n       Request with an ARP priority level associated with MPS or other\n       priority services, as configured by the operator.\n\n    -  One Paging Priority level can be used for multiple ARP priority\n       level values. The mapping of ARP priority level values to Paging\n       Priority level (or levels) is configured by operator policy.\n\n     During a congestion situation the eNodeB may prioritise the paging of\n       UEs according to the Paging Priority indications.\n\n     If the MME, while waiting for a UE response to the Paging Request\n    message sent without Paging Priority indication, receives an Update\n    Bearer Request, Create Bearer Request or Downlink Data Notification,\n    any of which indicates an ARP priority level associated with MPS or\n    other priority services, as configured by the operator, the MME shall\n    send another paging message with the suitable Paging Priority.\n\n     When the MME is configured to support CSG paging optimisation in the\n    CN, the MME should avoid sending Paging messages to those eNodeB(s)\n    with CSG cells for which the UE does not have a CSG subscription. When\n    the MME is configured to support CSG paging optimisation in the HeNB\n    Subsystem, the list of CSG IDs for paging is included in the Paging\n    message. For CSG paging optimisation, the CSG IDs of expired CSG\n    subscriptions and valid CSG subscriptions are both included in the\n    list. If the UE has emergency bearer service the MME shall not perform\n    the CSG paging optimisation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  An expired CSG subscription indicates that the UE is not allowed\n         service in the CSG. However, since the removal of the CSG from the\n         UE is pending, it is possible the UE will camp on that CSG and\n         therefore the UE is still paged for the CSG.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The eNodeB reports to the MME the CSG ID supported. For More\n         detail of this procedure refer to TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36].\n\n     When the MME supports SIPTO at Local Network and LIPA paging for\n    traffic arriving on the PDN connection with L-GW function collocated\n    with the (H)eNB the MME should only page this (H)eNB to avoid sending\n    Paging messages to eNodeB(s) that are not handling this specific PDN\n    connection.\n\n     Paging strategies may be configured in the MME for different\n    combinations of APN, Paging Policy Indication from SGW when available\n    (see clause\u00a04.9) and other EPS bearer context information e.g. QCI. APN\n    and any EPS bearer context information are identified by EPS bearer ID\n    received in Downlink Data Notification. Paging strategies may include:\n\n    -  paging retransmission scheme (e.g. how frequently the paging is\n       repeated or with what time interval);\n\n    -  determining whether to send the Paging message to the eNodeBs during\n       certain MME high load conditions;\n\n    -  whether to apply sub-area based paging (e.g. first page in the last\n       known ECGI or TA and retransmission in all registered TAs).\n\n     If extended idle mode DRX was enabled in the UE, the MME may\n    additionally take into account the Paging Time Window length for paging\n    retransmission schemes.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  The Paging priority in the Paging message is set based on\n         priority level of the ARP IE received in Downlink Data Notification\n         or Create/Update Bearer Request message and is independent from any\n         paging strategy.\n\n     The MME and the E-UTRAN may support further paging optimisations in\n    order to reduce the signalling load and the network resources used to\n    successfully page a UE by one or several following means:\n\n    -  by the MME implementating specific paging strategies (e.g. the S1\n       Paging message is sent to the eNB that served the UE last);\n\n    -  by the MME considering Information On Recommended Cells And ENBs\n       provided by the E-UTRAN at transition to ECM IDLE. The MME takes the\n       eNB related part of this information into account to determine the\n       eNBs to be paged, and provides the information on recommended cells\n       within the S1 Paging message to each of these eNBs;\n\n    -  by the E-UTRAN considering the Paging Attempt Count Information\n       provided by the MME at paging.\n\n     When implementing such optimisations/strategies, the MME shall take\n    into account any PSM active timer and the DRX interval for the UE.\n\n     If the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is available in the\n    MME, the MME adds the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information in the\n    S1 Paging message to the eNB.\n\n     If the Information On Recommended Cells And ENBs For Paging is\n    available in the MME, the MME shall take that information into account\n    to determine the eNBs for paging and, when paging an eNB, the MME may\n    transparently convey the information on recommended cells to the eNB.\n\n     The MME may include in the S1AP Paging message(s) the paging attempt\n    count information. The paging attempt count information shall be the\n    same for all eNBs selected by the MME for paging.\n\n     If the MME has Information for Enhanced Coverage stored and Enhanced\n    Coverage is not restricted then the MME shall include Information for\n    Enhanced Coverage in the Paging message for all eNBs selected by the\n    MME for paging. For including the Enhanced Coverage Restricted\n    parameter in the paging message, see clause\u00a04.3.28.\n\n     For including the CE mode B Restricted parameter in the Paging\n    message, see clause\u00a04.3.27a.\n\n  3b.  If the UE is registered in the SGSN, the SGSN sends paging messages\n    to RNC/BSS, which is described in detail in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\n  4a.  If eNodeBs receive paging messages from the MME, the UE is paged by\n    the eNodeBs. The step is described in detail in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] and\n    TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[34].\n\n  4b.  If RNC/BSS nodes receive paging messages from the SGSN the UE is\n    paged by the RNSC/BSS, which is described in detail in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7].\n\n  5. When UE is in the ECM-IDLE state, upon reception of paging indication\n    in E-UTRAN access, the UE initiates the UE triggered Service Request\n    procedure (clause\u00a05.3.4.1) or, if the UE is enabled to use User Plane\n    CIoT EPS Optimisation and there is suspended access stratum context\n    stored in the UE, the UE initiates the Connection Resume procedure\n    (clause\u00a05.3.5A). If the MME already has a signalling connection over S1-\n    MME towards the UE but the S1-U tunnel has not yet been established,\n    then the messages sequence performed start from the step when MME\n    establishes the bearer(s).\n\n     Upon reception of paging indication in UTRAN or GERAN access, the MS\n    shall respond in respective access as specified TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[47] and the\n    SGSN shall notify the S-GW.\n\n     The MME and/or SGSN supervises the paging procedure with a timer. If\n    the MME and/or SGSN receives no response from the UE to the Paging\n    Request message, it may repeat the paging according to any applicable\n    paging strategy described in step\u00a02.\n\n     If the MME and/or SGSN receives no response from the UE after this\n    paging repetition procedure, it shall use the Downlink Data\n    Notification Reject message to notify the Serving GW about the paging\n    failure, if paging was triggered by a Downlink Data Notification\n    message, unless the MME or SGSN is aware of an ongoing MM procedure\n    that prevents the UE from responding, i.e. the MME or SGSN received a\n    Context Request message indicating that the UE performs TAU or RAU\n    procedure with another MME or SGSN. If paging was triggered by control\n    signalling from the Serving GW and if the MME or SGSN receives no\n    response from the UE after this paging repetition procedure, the MME or\n    SGSN shall reject that control signalling. When a Downlink Data\n    Notification Reject message is received, if ISR is not activated, the\n    Serving GW deletes the buffered packet(s). If ISR is activated and the\n    Serving GW receives Downlink Data Notification Reject message from both\n    SGSN and MME, the Serving GW deletes the buffered packet(s) or rejects\n    the control signalling which triggers the Service Request procedure.\n    The Serving GW may invoke the procedure PDN GW Pause of Charging\n    (clause\u00a05.3.6A) if UE is in ECM IDLE and the PDN GW has enabled \"PDN\n    charging pause\" feature.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  The Serving GW may initiate the procedure PDN GW Pause of\n         Charging at any time before step\u00a05 if the UE is in ECM IDLE and the\n         PDN GW has indicated that the feature is enabled for this PDN. See\n         clause\u00a05.3.6A.\n\n  6a.  If ISR is activated and paging response is received in E-UTRAN\n    access the Serving GW sends a \"Stop Paging\" message to the SGSN.\n\n  6b.  If ISR is activated and paging response is received in UTRAN or\n    GERAN access the Serving GW sends a \"Stop Paging\" message to the MME.\n\nThe Serving GW transmits downlink data towards the UE via the RAT which\nperformed the Service Request procedure.\n\nFor a LIPA PDN connection, after the UE enters connected mode, the packets\nbuffered in the L-GW are forwarded to the HeNB on the direct path.

If there is a Service Gap timer running in the MME MM Context for the\n    UE and the MME is not waiting for a MT paging response from the UE, the\n    MME rejects the request by discarding the NAS data PDU and sending a\n    Service Reject message to the UE with an appropriate cause.

The Serving GW indicates each use of this\n    RRC establishment cause by the related counter on its CDR. The MME\n    maintains the MO Exception Data Counter for Serving PLMN Rate Control\n    purposes (see clause\u00a04.7.7.2). The MME may immediately send the MO\n    Exception Data Counter to the Serving GW. Alternatively, in order to\n    reduce signalling, the MME may send the MO Exception Data Counter to\n    the Serving GW as indicated in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43].\n\n  4b If the S11-U connection is established and the UE is accessing via the\n    NB-IoT RAT with the RRC establishment cause set to \"MO exception data\",\n    the MME should notify the Serving Gateway. The MME maintains the MO\n    Exception Data Counter for Serving PLMN Rate Control purposes (see\n    clause\u00a04.7.7.2). The MME may immediately send the MO Exception Data\n    Counter to the Serving GW. Alternatively, in order to reduce\n    signalling, the MME may send the MO Exception Data Counter to the\n    Serving GW as indicated in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43].\n\n  5. If the RAT Type has changed compared to the last reported RAT Type or\n    if the UE's Location and/or Info IEs and/or UE Time Zone and Serving\n    Network id are present in step\u00a04, the Serving GW shall send the Modify\n    Bearer Request message (RAT Type, MO Exception data counter) to the PDN\n    GW. User Location Information IE and/or User CSG Information IE and/or\n    Serving Network IE and/or UE Time Zone are also included if they are\n    present in step\u00a04.\n\n     If LTE-M RAT type and the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag were\n    received at step\u00a04a, the Serving GW shall include the LTE-M RAT type in\n    the Modify Bearer Request message to the PGW. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    includes RAT type WB-E-UTRAN.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons and the PDN GW charging is paused, then the SGWS-GW shall send\n    a Modify Bearer Request message with PDN Charging Pause Stop Indication\n    to inform the PDN GW that the charging is no longer paused. Other IEs\n    are not included in this message.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons but the MME indicated MO Exception data counter, then the\n    Serving Gateway should notify the PDN GW that this RRC establishment\n    cause has been used by the indication of the MO Exception Data Counter\n    (see TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43]). The Serving GW indicates each use of this RRC\n    establishment cause by the related counter on its CDR.\n\n  6. The PDN GW sends the Modify Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n\n     The PDN GW indicates each use of the RRC establishment cause \"MO\n    Exception Data\" by the related counter on its CDR.\n\n  7. If a Modify Bearer Request message was sent at step\u00a04 the Serving GW\n    shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW address and TEID for\n    uplink traffic) to the MME as a response to a Modify Bearer Request\n    message. The Serving GW address for S11-U User Plane and Serving GW\n    TEID are used by the MME to forward UL data to the SGW.\n\n  8. The MME sends Uplink data to the P-GW via the S-GW.\n\n  9. If no Downlink Data are expected based on the NAS Release Assistance\n    Information from the UE in step\u00a01, this means that all application\n    layer data exchanges have completed with the UL data transfer, and if\n    the MME is not aware of pending MT traffic and S1-U bearers are not\n    established, step\u00a010 is skipped and step\u00a011 applies.\n\n     Otherwise, Downlink data may arrive at the P-GW and the P-GW sends\n    them to the MME via the S-GW. If no data is received steps10-12 are\n    skipped and the eNB may trigger step\u00a014 after step\u00a013 detects no\n    activity. While the RRC connection is active, the UE may still send\n    Uplink data and may receive Downlink data in NAS PDUs that are carried\n    in a S1AP Uplink or (respectively) Downlink messages (not shown in the\n    figure). At any time the UE has no user plane bearers established it\n    may provide NAS Release Assistance Information with the Uplink data. In\n    this case, to assist Location Services, the eNB may indicate, if\n    needed, the UE's Coverage Level to the MME.\n\n  10.  If Downlink data are received in step\u00a09, the MME encrypts and\n    integrity protects the Downlink data.\n\n  11.  If step\u00a010 is executed then Downlink data are encapsulated in a NAS\n    PDU and sent to the eNB in a S1-AP Downlink NAS Message. If the\n    configuration in the MME indicates that the eNodeB supports\n    acknowledgements of downlink NAS data PDUs and if acknowledgements of\n    downlink NAS data PDUs are enabled in the subscription information for\n    the UE, the MME indicates in the S1-AP Downlink NAS message that\n    acknowledgment is requested from the eNodeB. For IP PDN type PDN\n    connections configured to support Header Compression, the MME shall\n    apply header compression before encapsulating data into the NAS\n    message. If step\u00a010 is not executed, or NAS Service Accept message is\n    not to be sent, the MME sends Connection Establishment Indication\n    message to the eNB to complete the establishment of the UE-associated\n    logical S1-connection. The UE Radio Capability may be provided from the\n    MME to the eNB in the DL NAS Transport message or Connection\n    Establishment Indication message, and the eNB shall store the received\n    UE Radio Capability information as specified in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n     If the NAS Release Assistance Information was received with Uplink\n    data and it indicated that Downlink data was expected, it means that\n    the next downlink packet following the sending of the NAS Release\n    Assistance Information is the last packet of the application layer data\n    exchange, then for this case, unless the MME is aware of additional\n    pending MT traffic and unless S1-U bearers are established, the MME\n    sends a S1 UE Context Release Command immediately after the S1-AP\n    message including the Downlink data encapsulated in NAS PDU as an\n    indication that the eNodeB shall release the RRC connection promptly\n    after successfully sending data to the UE. Alternatively, if \"EDT\n    Session\" indication was received in step\u00a02, the MME may include End\n    Indication for no further data in the S1-AP message including the\n    Downlink data encapsulated in NAS PDU. If the MME includes the End\n    Indication indicating no further data and if the eNB does not proceed\n    with RRC connection establishment, then the eNB skips step\u00a012a and\n    initiates step\u00a012b.\n\n     If the NAS Release Assistance Information was received indicating no\n    Downlink Data expected, it means that all application layer data\n    exchanges have completed with the UL data transfer, then for this case,\n    unless the MME is aware of additional pending MT traffic and unless S1-\n    U bearers are established:\n\n    -  the MME sends S1AP UE Context Release Command either:\n\n       -  immediately after the S1AP DL NAS TRANSPORT (NAS Service Accept),\n         in which case steps 12b and 14 are skipped, or\n\n       -  immediately after S1AP CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION, in\n         which case steps 12a, 12b, 13, and 14 are skipped.\n\n    -  Alternatively, if the MME received \"EDT Session\" indication from the\n       eNB in step\u00a02, the MME should include End Indication with no further\n       data in S1AP DL NAS TRANSPORT (NAS Service Accept) or S1AP CONNECTION\n       ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION. If the eNB does not proceed with RRC\n       connection establishment, the eNB skips step\u00a012a and initiates\n       stop\u00a012b.\n\n     If the UE is accessing via an NB-IoT cell, or if it is accessing via\n    an WB-E-UTRAN cell and is capable of CE mode B, to determine the NAS\n    PDU retransmission strategy the MME should take into account the\n    transmission delay of the NAS PDU and the CE mode B Restricted\n    parameter stored in the MME's MM context and, if applicable, the CE\n    mode, i.e. set the NAS timers long enough according to the worst\n    transmission delay (see TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46]).\n\n  12a. The eNB sends a RRC Downlink data message including the Downlink\n    data encapsulated in NAS PDU. If in step\u00a011 the S1-AP message with the\n    NAS DATA PDU was followed by an S1 UE Context Release Command, step\u00a015\n    is completed promptly after the Downlink Data transmission of the NAS\n    PDU to the UE and the acknowledgement to MME in step\u00a013 have been\n    completed at the eNB, and the eNB does not need to enter step\u00a014. If\n    header compression was applied to the PDN, the UE would perform header\n    decompression to rebuild the IP header.\n\n  12b. If End Indication with no further data is received in S1AP message\n    from the MME, the eNB may send the RRCEarlyDataComplete message with\n    any NAS payload received from step\u00a011 (either NAS data PDU or NAS\n    service accept) as defined in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. Step\u00a014 is skipped in this\n    case.\n\n  13.  The eNodeB sends a NAS Delivery indication to the MME if requested.\n    If the eNodeB reports an unsuccessful delivery with an S1-AP NAS Non\n    Delivery Indication, the MME should wait for some time until the UE has\n    potentially changed cell and re-established contact with the MME, by\n    which MME should resend the Downlink S1-AP message to the eNodeB,\n    otherwise the MME reports an unsuccessful delivery to the SCEF in case\n    of T6a procedure (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74], clause\u00a05.13.3). If the eNodeB\n    reports a successful delivery with an S1-AP NAS Delivery Indication and\n    if the Downlink data was received over the T6a interface, the MME\n    should respond to the SCEF (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74], clause\u00a05.13.3). If the\n    eNodeB does not support S1-AP NAS delivery indications, the MME\n    indicates a cause code 'Success Unacknowledged Delivery' to the SCEF\n    otherwise 'Success Acknowledged Delivery', for the SCEF to know if\n    reliable delivery was possible or not.\n\n  14.  If no NAS PDU activity exists for a while, the eNB starts an S1\n    release in step\u00a015.\n\n  15.  An S1 release procedure according to clause\u00a05.3.5 triggered by the\n    eNodeB or MME. Alternatively, if the MME in step\u00a011 sent S1 UE Context\n    Release Command then the procedure starts with step\u00a05 in clause\u00a05.3.5,\n    or Connection Suspend Procedure defined in clause\u00a05.3.4A.

The steps below are not executed.\n\n     If that MME has requested the S-GW to delay sending the Downlink Data\n    Notification (see clause\u00a05.3.4.2 on \"Handling of abnormal conditions in\n    UE triggered Service Request\"), the Serving GW buffers the downlink\n    data and waits until the timer expires before continuing with step\u00a02.\n    If the DL-TEID and MME address for that UE is received before the\n    expiry of the timer, the timer shall be cancelled and the Mobile\n    Terminated Data transport procedure is progressed from step\u00a011 as\n    Downlink data are sent to the UE.\n\n     If the Serving GW receives additional downlink data packets/control\n    signalling for this UE before the expiry of the timer, the Serving GW\n    does not restart this timer.\n\n  2. If the Serving GW is buffering data in step\u00a01, the Serving GW sends a\n    Downlink Data Notification message (ARP, EPS Bearer ID) to the MME for\n    which it has control plane connectivity for the given UE. The ARP and\n    EPS Bearer ID are always set in Downlink Data Notification. The MME\n    responds to the S-GW with a Downlink Data Notification Ack message.\n\n     An MME detects that the UE is in a power saving state (e.g. Power\n    Saving Mode) and cannot be reached by paging at the time of receiving\n    Downlink data notification, shall invoke extended buffering depending\n    on operator configuration, except for cases described in next\n    paragraphs. The MME derives the expected time before radio bearers can\n    be established to the UE. The MME then indicates Downlink Buffering\n    Requested to the Serving GW in the Downlink Data Notification Ack\n    message and includes a Downlink Buffering Duration time and optionally\n    a Downlink Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The MME stores a new value\n    for the Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time in the MM context for the\n    UE based on the Downlink Buffering Duration time and skips the\n    remaining steps of this procedure. The Downlink Data Buffer Expiration\n    Time is used for UEs using power saving state and indicates that there\n    are buffered data in the Serving GW and that the user plane setup\n    procedure is needed when the UE makes signalling with the network. When\n    the Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time has expired, the MME considers\n    no Downlink data to be buffered and no indications of Buffered Downlink\n    Data Waiting are sent during context transfers at TAU procedures.\n\n     If there is an \"Availability after DDN Failure\" monitoring event\n    configured for the UE in the MME, the MME does not invoke extended\n    buffering. Instead, the MME sets the Notify-on-available-after-DDN-\n    failure flag to remember to send an \"Availability after DDN Failure\"\n    notification when the UE becomes available. If there is a \"UE\n    Reachability\" monitoring event configured for the UE in the MME, the\n    MME does not invoke extended buffering.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  When \"Availability after DDN failure\" and \"UE reachability\"\n         monitoring events are used for a UE, the application server is\n         assumed to send data only when the UE is reachable, hence no\n         extended buffering is needed. If there are multiple application\n         servers, the event notifications and extended buffering may be\n         needed simultaneously. It is assumed this is handled through\n         additional information based on SLA as described in the next\n         paragraph.\n\n     The MME may use additional information based on a SLA with the MTC\n    user for when to invoke extended buffering, e.g. only invoke it for a\n    certain APN, do not invoke it for certain subscribers, invoke extended\n    buffering in conjunction with \"Availability after DDN failure\" and \"UE\n    reachability\" monitoring events, etc.\n\n     A Serving GW that receives a Downlink Buffering Requested indication\n    in a Downlink Data Notification Ack message stores a new value for the\n    Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time based on the Downlink Buffering\n    Duration time and does not send any additional Downlink Data\n    Notification if subsequent downlink data packets are received in the\n    Serving GW before the buffer time Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time\n    has expired for the UE.\n\n     If the Serving GW, while waiting for the user plane to be established,\n    is triggered to send a second Downlink Data Notification for a bearer\n    with higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level) than that of the bearer\n    for which the first Downlink Data Notification was sent, the S-GW sends\n    a new Downlink Data Notification message indicating the higher priority\n    to the MME. If the Serving GW receives additional downlink data packets\n    for a bearer with same or lower priority than the first Downlink Data\n    Notification was sent for or if the Serving GW has sent the second\n    Downlink Data Notification message indicating the higher priority and\n    receives additional downlink data packets for this UE, the Serving GW\n    buffers these downlink data packets and does not send a new Downlink\n    Data Notification.\n\n     If the Serving GW, while waiting for the user plane to be established,\n    receives a Modify Bearer Request message from an MME other than the one\n    it sent a Downlink Data Notification message to, the Serving GW re-\n    sends the Downlink Data Notification message but only to the new MME\n    from which it received the Modify Bearer Request message.\n\n     Upon reception of a Downlink Data Notification Ack message with an\n    indication that the Downlink Data Notification message has been\n    temporarily rejected and if the Downlink Data Notification is triggered\n    by the arrival of downlink data packets at the Serving GW, the Serving\n    GW may start a locally configured guard timer and buffers all downlink\n    user packets received to the given UE and waits for a Modify Bearer\n    Request message to come. Upon reception of a Modify Bearer Request\n    message, the Serving GW re-sends the Downlink Data Notification message\n    but only to the new MME from which it received the Modify Bearer\n    Request message. Otherwise the Serving GW releases buffered downlink\n    user packets upon expiry of the guard timer or upon receiving the\n    Delete Session Request message from MME.\n\n     If the S11-U is already established (buffering is in the MME), step\u00a02\n    is not executed and step\u00a011 is immediately executed. Steps 7,8,9,10 are\n    executed only if conditions are met when the NAS control plane service\n    request is received at step\u00a06, as outlined below in the respective\n    clauses.\n\n     An MME detecting that the UE is in a power saving state (e.g. Power\n    Saving Mode) and cannot be reached by paging at the time of receiving\n    Downlink data, shall start extended buffering depending on operator\n    configuration, except for cases described in next paragraphs. The MME\n    derives the expected time before radio bearers can be established to\n    the UE, stores a new value for the Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time\n    in the MM context for the UE and skips the remaining steps of this\n    procedure. When the Downlink Data Buffer Expiration Time has expired,\n    the MME considers no Downlink data to be buffered.\n\n     Also for the case of buffering in the MME the \"Availability after DDN\n    Failure\" monitoring event can be configured for the UE, even though the\n    actual DDN is not received and the Downlink data is received. The \"UE\n    Reachability\" monitoring event can be configured.also. The extended\n    buffering can also be configured as per what is described above in this\n    step\u00a0of the procedure for the case of buffering in S-GW.\n\n  3. If the UE is registered in the MME and considered reachable, the MME\n    sends a Paging message (NAS ID for paging, TAI(s), UE identity based\n    DRX index, Paging DRX length, list of CSG IDs for paging, Paging\n    Priority indication, Enhanced Coverage Restricted, CE mode B\n    Restricted) to each eNodeB belonging to the tracking area(s) in which\n    the UE is registered.\n\n     Paging priority indication is included only:\n\n    -  if the MME receives a Downlink Data Notification (or a Downlink\n       packet for a EPS bearer, for the case of buffering in MME) with an\n       ARP priority level associated with priority services, as configured\n       by the operator.\n\n    -  One Paging Priority level can be used for multiple ARP priority\n       level values. The mapping of ARP priority level values to Paging\n       Priority level (or levels) is configured by operator policy.\n\n     During a congestion situation the eNodeB may prioritise the paging of\n       UEs according to the Paging Priority indications.\n\n     If the MME, while waiting for a UE response to the Paging Request\n       message sent without Paging Priority indication, receives a Downlink\n       Data Notification (or a Downlink packet for a EPS bearer, for the\n       case of buffering in MME) which indicates an ARP priority level\n       associated with priority services, as configured by the operator, the\n       MME shall send another paging message with the suitable Paging\n       Priority.\n\n     When the MME is configured to support CSG paging optimisation in the\n       CN, the MME should avoid sending Paging messages to those eNodeB(s)\n       with CSG cells for which the UE does not have a CSG subscription.\n       When the MME is configured to support CSG paging optimisation in the\n       HeNB Subsystem, the list of CSG IDs for paging is included in the\n       Paging message. For CSG paging optimisation, the CSG IDs of expired\n       CSG subscriptions and valid CSG subscriptions are both included in\n       the list. If the UE has emergency bearer service the MME shall not\n       perform the CSG paging optimisation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  An expired CSG subscription indicates that the UE is not allowed\n         service in the CSG. However, since the removal of the CSG from the\n         UE is pending, it is possible the UE will camp on that CSG and\n         therefore the UE is still paged for the CSG.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The eNodeB reports to the MME the CSG ID supported. For More\n         detail of this procedure refer to TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36].\n\n     Paging strategies may be configured in the MME. Paging strategies may\n       include:\n\n    -  paging retransmission scheme (e.g. how frequently the paging is\n       repeated or with what time interval);\n\n    -  determining whether to send the Paging message to the eNodeBs during\n       certain MME high load conditions;\n\n    -  whether to apply sub-area based paging (e.g. first page in the last\n       known ECGI or TA and retransmission in all registered TAs).\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The Paging priority in the Paging message is set based on\n         priority level of the ARP IE received in Downlink Data Notification\n         or Create/Update Bearer Request message and is independent from any\n         paging strategy.\n\n     The MME and the E-UTRAN may support further paging optimisations in\n    order to reduce the signalling load and the network resources used to\n    successfully page a UE by one or several following means:\n\n    -  by the MME implementating specific paging strategies (e.g. the S1\n       Paging message is sent to the eNB that served the UE last);\n\n    -  by the MME considering Information On Recommended Cells And eNodeBs\n       provided by the E-UTRAN at transition to ECM IDLE. The MME takes the\n       eNB related part of this information into account to determine the\n       eNBs to be paged, and provides the information on recommended cells\n       within the S1 Paging message to each of these eNBs;\n\n    -  by the E-UTRAN considering the Paging Attempt Count Information\n       provided by the MME at paging.\n\n     When implementing such optimisations/strategies, the MME shall take\n    into account any PSM active timer and the DRX interval for the UE.\n\n     If the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is available in the\n    MME, the MME adds the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information in the\n    S1 Paging message to the eNB.\n\n     If the Information on Recommended Cells And ENBs For Paging is\n    available in the MME, the MME shall take that information into account\n    to determine the eNBs for paging and, when paging an eNB, the MME may\n    transparently convey the information on recommended cells to the eNB.\n\n     The MME may include in the S1AP Paging message(s) the paging attempt\n    count information. The paging attempt count information shall be the\n    same for all eNBs selected by the MME for paging.\n\n     If the MME has Information for Enhanced Coverage stored and Enhanced\n    Coverage is not restricted then the MME shall include Information for\n    Enhanced Coverage in the Paging message for all eNBs selected by the\n    MME for paging. For including the Enhanced Coverage Restricted\n    parameter in the paging message, see clause\u00a04.3.28.\n\n     For including the CE mode B Restricted parameter in the Paging\n    message, see clause\u00a04.3.27a.\n\n  4. If eNodeBs receive paging messages from the MME, the UE is paged by\n    the eNodeBs.\n\n  5. As the UE is in the ECM-IDLE state, upon reception of paging\n    indication, the UE sends Control Plane Service Request NAS message (as\n    defined in TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46]) over RRC Connection request and S1-AP\n    initial message. The Control Plane Service Request NAS message, when\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies, does not trigger Data\n    radio bearer establishment by the MME and the MME can immediately send\n    Downlink Data it receives using a NAS PDU to the eNodeB. The MME\n    supervises the paging procedure with a timer. If the MME receives no\n    response from the UE to the Paging Request message, it may repeat the\n    paging according to any applicable paging strategy described in step\u00a03.\n\n  5b.  In the NB-IoT case, the eNB, based on configuration, may retrieve\n    the EPS negotiated QoS profile from the MME, if not previously\n    retrieved. The MME Code within the S-TMSI in the RRCConnectionRequest\n    message is used to identify the MME. In the case of network sharing,\n    the MME Codes shall be unique within the area of overlapping MME pools\n    of the participating operators. The eNB may apply prioritisation\n    between requests from different UEs before triggering step\u00a06 and\n    throughout the RRC connection. The eNB may retrieve additional\n    parameters (e.g., UE Radio Capabilities - see TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]).\n\n  6. If the MME receives no response from the UE after this paging\n    repetition procedure, it shall use the Downlink Data Notification\n    Reject message to notify the Serving GW about the paging failure (or,\n    equivalently, if the buffering is in the MME, the MME simply discards\n    data for the UE locally), unless the MME is aware of an ongoing MM\n    procedure that prevents the UE from responding, i.e. the MME received a\n    Context Request message indicating that the UE performs TAU with\n    another MME. When a Downlink Data Notification Reject message is\n    received, the Serving GW deletes the buffered packet(s). The Serving GW\n    may invoke the procedure PDN GW Pause of Charging (clause\u00a05.3.6A) if UE\n    is in ECM IDLE and the PDN GW has enabled \"PDN charging pause\" feature.\n    If buffering is in the MME, Pause Charging is triggered by the MME via\n    a Release Access Bearer Request to the S-GW(not shown in Figure\n    5.3.4B.3-1) including a \"Abnormal Release of Radio Link\" cause , which\n    releases the S11-U.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The Serving GW (or MME, in the case of buffering in the MME) may\n         initiate the procedure P-GW Pause of Charging at any time before\n         step\u00a05 if the UE is in ECM IDLE and the P-GW has indicated that the\n         feature is enabled for this PDN. See clause\u00a05.3.6A.0.\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB indicates the UE's Coverage Level\n    to the MME.\n\n     The MME performs (and the UE responds to) any EMM or ESM procedures if\n    necessary, e.g. the security related procedures. Steps 7 to 11 can\n    continue in parallel to this, however, steps 12 and 13 shall await\n    completion of all the EMM and ESM procedures.\n\n  7. If the S11-U is not established, the MME sends a Modify Bearer Request\n    message (MME address, MME TEID DL, Delay Downlink Packet Notification\n    Request, RAT Type, LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag) for each PDN\n    connection to the Serving GW. The Serving GW is now able to transmit\n    downlink data towards the UE. The usage of the Delay Downlink Packet\n    Notification Request Information Element is specified in clause\u00a05.3.4.2\n    with reference to the UE initiated service request procedure, but it\n    equally applies in this case. The MME shall indicate S11-U tunnelling\n    of NAS user data and send its own S11-U IP address and MME DL TEID for\n    DL data forwarding by the SGW. Also, regardless of whether the S11-U\n    was already established:\n\n    -  If the P-GW requested UE's location and/or User CSG information and\n       the UE's location and/or User CSG information has changed, the MME\n       shall send the Modify Bearer Request message and also includes the\n       User Location Information IE and/or User CSG Information IE in this\n       message.\n\n    -  If the Serving Network IE has changed compared to the last reported\n       Serving Network IE then the MME shall send the Modify Bearer Request\n       message and also includes the Serving Network IE in this message.\n\n    -  If the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE\n       Time Zone then the MME shall send the Modify Bearer Request message\n       and include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\n\n     If the RAT type currently used is NB-IOT this shall be reported as\n    different from other -E-UTRA flavours.\n\n     If the UE is using the LTE-M RAT type and the PDN GW expects the LTE-M\n    RAT type reporting as specified in clause\u00a05.11.5, the MME also includes\n    the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag to indicate to the Serving GW\n    to forward the LTE-M RAT type to the PDN GW.\n\n  8. If the RAT Type has changed compared to the last reported RAT Type or\n    if the UE's Location and/or Info IEs and/or UE Time Zone and Serving\n    Network id are present in step\u00a07, the Serving GW shall send the Modify\n    Bearer Request message (RAT Type) to the P-GW. User Location\n    Information IE and/or User CSG Information IE and/or Serving Network IE\n    and/or UE Time Zone are also included if they are present in step\u00a07.\n\n     If LTE-M RAT type and the LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag were\n    received at step\u00a07, the Serving GW shall include the LTE-M RAT type in\n    the Modify Bearer Request message to the PGW. Otherwise the Serving GW\n    includes RAT type WB-E-UTRAN.\n\n     If the Modify Bearer Request message is not sent because of above\n    reasons and the PDN GW charging is paused, then the S-GW shall send a\n    Modify Bearer Request message with PDN Charging Pause Stop Indication\n    to inform the PDN GW that the charging is no longer paused. Other IEs\n    are not included in this message.\n\n  9. The PDN GW sends the Modify Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n\n  10.  If a Modify Bearer Request message was sent at step\u00a07, the Serving\n    GW shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW address and TEID\n    for uplink traffic) to the MME as a response to a Modify Bearer Request\n    message. The Serving GW address for S11-U User Plane and Serving GW\n    TEID are used by the MME to forward UL data to the SGW.\n\n  11.  Buffered (if S11-U was not established) Downlink data is sent by the\n    S-GW to the MME.\n\n  12-13. The MME encrypts and integrity protects Downlink data and sends it\n    to the eNodeB using a NAS PDU carried by a Downlink S1-AP message. If\n    the configuration in the MME indicates that the eNodeB supports\n    acknowledgements of downlink NAS data PDUs and if acknowledgements of\n    downlink NAS data PDUs are enabled in the subscription information for\n    the UE, the MME indicates in the Downlink S1-AP message that\n    acknowledgment is requested from the eNodeB. For IP PDN type PDN\n    connections configured to support Header Compression, the MME shall\n    apply header compression before encapsulating data into the NAS\n    message. Alternatively and if the MME decides that S1-U bearers need to\n    be established in case the UE and MME accept User Plane EPS\n    Optimisation or S1-U data transfer, steps 4-12 from clause\u00a05.3.4.1 are\n    followed.\n\n     If the UE is accessing via an NB-IoT cell, or if it is accessing via\n    an WB-E-UTRAN cell and is capable of CE mode B, to determine the NAS\n    PDU retransmission strategy the MME should take into account the\n    transmission delay of the NAS PDU and the CE mode B Restricted\n    parameter stored in the MME's MM context and, if applicable, the CE\n    mode, i.e. set the NAS timers long enough according to the worst\n    transmission delay (see TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46]).\n\n  14.  The NAS PDU with data is delivered to the UE via a Downlink RRC\n    message. This is taken by the UE as implicit acknowledgment of the\n    Service Request message sent in step\u00a05. If header compression was\n    applied, to the PDN, the UE shall perform header decompression to\n    rebuild the IP header.\n\n  15.  The eNodeB sends a NAS Delivery indication to the MME if requested.\n    If the eNodeB reports an unsuccessful delivery with an S1-AP NAS Non\n    Delivery Indication, the MME should wait for some time until the UE has\n    potentially changed cell and re-established contact with the MME, by\n    which MME should resend the Downlink S1-AP message to the eNodeB,\n    otherwise the MME reports an unsuccessful delivery to the SCEF in case\n    of T6a procedure (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74], clause\u00a05.13.3). If the eNodeB\n    reports a successful delivery with an S1-AP NAS Delivery Indication and\n    if the Downlink data was received over the T6a interface, the MME\n    should respond to the SCEF (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74], clause\u00a05.13.3). If the\n    eNodeB does not support S1-AP NAS delivery indications, the MME\n    indicates a cause code 'Success Unacknowledged Delivery' to the SCEF\n    otherwise 'Success Acknowledged Delivery', for the SCEF to know if\n    reliable delivery was possible or not.\n\n  16.  While the RRC connection is still up, further Uplink and Downlink\n    data can be transferred using NAS PDUs. In step\u00a017 an Uplink data\n    transfer is shown using an Uplink RRC message encapsulating a NAS PDU\n    with data. At any time the UE has no user plane bearers established,\n    the UE may provide a Release Assistance Information with Uplink data in\n    the NAS PDU.\n\n     For IP PDN type PDN connections configured to support Header\n    Compression, the UE shall apply header compression before encapsulating\n    it into the NAS message.\n\n  17.  The NAS PDU with data is send to the MME in a Uplink S1-AP message.\n\n     To assist Location Services, the eNB may indicate, if changed, the\n    UE's Coverage Level to the MME.\n\n     If the Release Assistance Information is received from the UE it\n    overrides the Traffic Profile (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]) and the MME does not\n    send the Traffic Profile to the eNB.\n\n  18.  The data is checked for integrity and decrypted. If header\n    compression was applied to the PDN, the MME shall perform header\n    decompression to rebuild the IP header.\n\n  19.  The MME sends Uplink data to the PDN GW via the S-GW and executes\n    any action related to the presence of Release Assistance Information as\n    follows:\n\n    -  for the case where the Release Assistance Information indicates\n       there is no downlink data to follow the uplink data then unless the\n       MME is aware of pending MT traffic, and unless S1-U bearers exist,\n       the MME immediately releases the connection and therefore step\u00a021 is\n       executed.\n\n    -  for the case where the Release Assistance Information indicates that\n       downlink data will follow the uplink transmission then unless the MME\n       is aware of additional pending MT traffic and unless S1-U bearers\n       exist, the MME sends a S1 UE Context Release Command to the eNodeB\n       immediately after the S1-AP message including the Downlink data\n       encapsulated in NAS PDU.\n\n  20.  If no NAS activity exists for a while the eNB detects inactivity and\n    executes step\u00a021.\n\n  21.

The MME either because it\nhas received the NAS message as defined in steps 2-3 or the MME decides\nthat S1-U based data transfer is now preferred e.g. determined by the size\nof data transferred in UL and DL using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\ntriggers the establishment of S1-U bearer(s). The MME checks if the UE can\nsupport the establishment of required number of additional user plane radio\nbearers based on the maximum number of user plane radio bearers indicated\nby UE in the UE Network Capability IE as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3. If the\nMME takes the decision that S1-U data transfer is now preferred steps 2-3\nare not needed.\n\n  1. UE is sending and receiving data in NAS PDUs using the Control Plane\n    CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n\n  2. The UE may be triggered to establish user plane bearers and sends a\n    Control Plane Service Request with an active flag towards the MME\n    encapsulated in an RRC message to the eNodeB. The RRC message and this\n    NAS message are described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] and TS\u00a024.301\u00a0[46]\n    respectively.\n\n  3. The eNodeB forwards the Control Plane Service Request with active flag\n    to MME. NAS message is encapsulated in an S1-AP UL NAS Transport\n    Message (NAS message, TAI+ECGI of the serving cell, S-TMSI, CSG ID, CSG\n    access Mode). Details of this step\u00a0are described in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. If\n    the MME receives the Control Plane Service Request with active flag\n    defined in steps 2-3 it shall establish S1-U bearer(s) and execute the\n    transfer. If the MME cannot handle the procedure associated to the\n    Control Plane Service Request with active flag, it shall reject it. CSG\n    ID is provided if the UE sends the NAS message via a CSG cell or a\n    hybrid cell. CSG access mode is provided if the UE sends the NAS\n    message via a hybrid cell. If the CSG access mode is not provided but\n    the CSG ID is provided, the MME shall consider the cell as a CSG\n    cell.If a CSG ID is indicated and CSG access mode is not provided, and\n    there is no subscription data for this CSG ID and associated PLMN or\n    the CSG subscription is expired, the MME rejects the Control Plane\n    Service Request with an appropriate cause. The UE shall remove the CSG\n    ID and associated PLMN of the cell where the UE has initiated the\n    service request procedure from the Allowed CSG list, if present.\n\n  4. The MME shall send any remaining UL data over S11-U and in order to\n    minimize the possible occurrence of out of order DL data e.g. caused by\n    earlier DL data which were sent on the Control Plane may send a Release\n    Access Bearers Request message to the Serving GW that requests the\n    release of all S11-U bearers for the UE. The MME locally deletes any\n    existing ROHC context used for Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, and\n    other S11-U related information in UE context, including TEID (DL) for\n    the S11-U, etc, but not the Header Compression Configuration.\n\n  NOTE:  The MME may use the \"Delay Downlink Packet Notification Request\"\n         causing the Serving GW to not send Downlink Data Notifications as\n         described in clause\u00a05.3.4.2 to minimize the impact of possible\n         Downlink Data Notifications this step\u00a0may cause.\n\n  5. If the Serving GW receives the Release Access Bearers Request message\n    it releases all MME related information (address and downlink TEIDs)\n    for the UE and responds with a Release Access Bearers Response message\n    to the MME. Other elements of the UE's Serving GW context are not\n    affected. If downlink packets arrive for the UE, the Serving GW starts\n    buffering downlink packets received for the UE and initiating the\n    \"Network Triggered Service Request\" procedure, described in\n    clause\u00a05.3.4.3.\n\n  6. The MME sends S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request (Serving GW address,\n    S1-TEID(s) (UL), EPS Bearer QoS(s), Security Context, MME Signalling\n    Connection Id, Handover Restriction List, CSG Membership Indication,\n    Service Accept) message to the eNodeB for all PDN connections that MME\n    has not included Control Plane Only Indicator in ESM request. The MME\n    responds to the UE with a Service Accept message. The eNodeB stores the\n    Security Context, MME Signalling Connection Id, EPS Bearer QoS(s) and\n    S1-TEID(s) in the UE RAN context. The step\u00a0is described in detail in\n    TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. Handover Restriction List is described in clause\u00a04.3.5.7\n    \"Mobility Restrictions\".\n\n  7. If the Control Plane Service Request is performed via a hybrid cell,\n    CSG Membership Indication indicating whether the UE is a CSG member\n    shall be included in the S1-AP message from the MME to the RAN. Based\n    on this information the RAN can perform differentiated treatment for\n    CSG and non-CSG members. The eNodeB performs the radio bearer\n    establishment procedure. The user plane security is established at this\n    step, which is described in detail in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. The UE needs to\n    locally delete any existing ROHC context used for Control Plane CIoT\n    EPS Optimisation. When the user plane radio bearers are setup, EPS\n    bearer state synchronization is performed between the UE and the\n    network, i.e. the UE shall locally remove any EPS bearer for which the\n    MME has not included Control Plane Only Indicator in ESM request and\n    for which no radio bearers are setup. If the radio bearer for a default\n    EPS bearer is not established, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS\n    bearers associated to that default EPS bearer.\n\n  8. As the user plane radio bearers are setup the UE shall use user plane\n    bearers to transfer data PDUs, except for EPS bearers the MME has\n    included Control Plane Only Indicator in ESM request and for which\n    Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation is still be used. The uplink data\n    from the UE can now be forwarded by eNodeB to the Serving GW. The\n    eNodeB sends the uplink data to the Serving GW address and TEID\n    provided in the step\u00a06. The Serving GW forwards the uplink data to the\n    PDN GW.\n\n  9. The eNodeB sends an S1-AP message Initial Context Setup Complete\n    (eNodeB address, List of accepted EPS bearers, List of rejected EPS\n    bearers, S1 TEID(s) (DL)) to the MME. This step\u00a0is described in detail\n    in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  10.  The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request message (eNodeB address, S1\n    TEID(s) (DL) for the accepted EPS bearers, Delay Downlink Packet\n    Notification Request, RAT Type) per PDN connection to the Serving GW.\n    If the Serving GW supports Modify Access Bearers Request procedure and\n    if there is no need for the Serving GW to send the signalling to the\n    PDN GW, the MME may send Modify Access Bearer Request (eNodeB\n    address(es) and TEIDs for downlink user plane for the accepted EPS\n    bearers, Delay Downlink Packet Notification Request) per UE to the\n    Serving GW to optimise the signalling. The Serving GW is now able to\n    transmit downlink data towards the UE.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW\n    address and TEID for uplink traffic) to the MME as a response to a\n    Modify Bearer Request message, or a Modify Access Bearers Response\n    (Serving GW address and TEID for uplink traffic) as a response to a\n    Modify Access Bearers Request message. If the Serving GW cannot serve\n    the MME Request in the Modify Access Bearers Request message without\n    S5/S8 signalling other than to unpause charging in the PDN GW or\n    without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8\n    interface, it shall respond to the MME with indicating that the\n    modifications are not limited to S1-U bearers, and the MME shall repeat\n    its request using a Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "eNB Control Plane Relocation Indication procedure", "numbering": "5.3.4B.5", "title_level": 3, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "S release procedure", "numbering": "5.3.5", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.3.4B.5 eNB Control Plane Relocation Indication procedure\n\nFor intra-NB-IoT mobility for UE and MME using Control Plane CIoT EPS\nOptimisation the eNB CP Relocation Indication procedures may be used. The\npurpose of the eNB CP Relocation Indication procedure is to request the MME\nto authenticate the UE's re-establishment request as described in\nTS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41], and initiate the establishment of the UE's S1 connection\nand, if necessary, the S11-U connection after the UE has initiated a RRC Re-\nestablishment procedure in a new eNB.\n\nMore details are defined in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n\n5.3.5  S1 release procedure\n\nThis procedure is used to release the logical S1-AP signalling connection\n(over S1-MME) and all S1 bearers (in S1-U) for a UE. This Procedure\nreleases the S11-U bearer in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation (except in\ncase of buffering in MME), instead of the S1-U bearer. The procedure will\nmove the UE from ECM-CONNECTED to ECM-IDLE in both the UE and MME, and all\nUE related context information is deleted in the eNodeB. When the S1-AP\nsignalling connection is lost, e.g. due to loss of the signalling transport\nor because of an eNodeB or MME failure, the S1 release procedure is\nperformed locally by the eNodeB and by the MME. When the S1 release\nprocedure is performed locally by the eNodeB or by the MME each node\nperforms locally its actions as described in the procedure flow below\nwithout using or relying on any of the signalling shown directly between\neNodeB and MME.\n\nIf Service Gap Control shall be applied for the UE (see clause\u00a04.3.17.9)\nand the Service Gap timer is not already running, the Service Gap timer\nshall be started in MME and UE when entering ECM-IDLE, unless the\nconnection was initiated after a paging of an MT event, or after a TAU\nprocedure without any active flag set or signalling active flag set.\n\nThe initiation of S1 Release procedure is either:\n\n  -  eNodeB-initiated with cause e.g. O&M Intervention, Unspecified\n    Failure, User Inactivity, Repeated RRC signalling Integrity Check\n    Failure, Release due to UE generated signalling connection release, CS\n    Fallback triggered, Inter-RAT Redirection, etc. as defined in\n    TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]; or\n\n  -  MME-initiated with cause e.g. authentication failure, detach, not\n    allowed CSG cell (e.g. the CSG ID of the currently used CSG cell\n    expires or is removed from the CSG subscription data), etc.\n\nBoth eNodeB-initiated and MME-initiated S1 release procedures are shown in\nFigure 5.3.5-1.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                    Figure 5.3.5-1: S1 Release Procedure\n\n  1a.  In certain cases the eNodeB may release the UE's signalling\n    connection before or in parallel to requesting the MME to release the\n    S1 context, e.g. the eNodeB initiates an RRC Connection Release for CS\n    Fallback by redirection. If the reason for the release is that the\n    eNodeB received Release Assistance Indicator in Access Stratum as\n    defined in TS\u00a036.321\u00a0[87], the eNodeB should not immediately release\n    the RRC connection, instead send S1 UE context Release Request with\n    appropriate cause value e.g. user inactivity.\n\n  1b.  If the eNodeB detects a need to release the UE's signalling\n    connection and all radio bearers for the UE, the eNodeB sends an S1 UE\n    Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates the\n    reason for the release (e.g. O&M intervention, unspecified failure,\n    user inactivity, repeated integrity checking failure, or release due to\n    UE generated signalling connection release).\n\n     If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT reporting and the eNodeB has\n    Secondary RAT usage data to report, the Secondary RAT usage data is\n    included in S1 UE Context Release Request.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Step 1 is only performed when the eNodeB-initiated S1 release\n         procedure is considered. Step 1 is not performed and the procedure\n         starts with Step 2 when the MME-initiated S1 release procedure is\n         considered.\n\n     The MME upon receiving S1 UE context Release Request with Cause=user\n    inactivity continues with the S1 release procedure unless the MME is\n    aware of pending MT traffic or signalling and/or NAS Release Assistance\n    Information that may have been received in NAS PDU when Control Plane\n    CIoT EPS Optimisation is used, which indicates that downlink data is\n    expected.\n\n     For Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation with data buffering in the\n    MME, step\u00a02 and step\u00a03 are skipped.\n\n  2. The MME sends a Release Access Bearers Request (Abnormal Release of\n    Radio Link Indication, Secondary RAT usage data) message to the S-GW\n    that requests the release of all S1-U bearers for the UE, or the S11-U\n    in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation if buffering is in the S-GW.\n    This message is triggered either by an S1 Release Request message from\n    the eNodeB, or by another MME event. The Abnormal Release of Radio Link\n    Indication is included if the S1 release procedure is due to an\n    abnormal release of the radio link. If secondary RAT usage data was\n    received in Step 1b, the MME includes Secondary RAT usage data in this\n    message.\n\n  3. If the S-GW has received a Release Access Bearers Request, the S-GW\n    releases all eNodeB related information (address and TEIDs), or the MME\n    TEIDs related information in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\n    (address and TEIDs), for the UE and responds with a Release Access\n    Bearers Response message to the MME. Other elements of the UE's S-GW\n    context are not affected. The S-GW retains the S1-U configuration that\n    the S-GW allocated for the UE's bearers. The S-GW starts buffering\n    downlink packets received for the UE and initiating the \"Network\n    Triggered Service Request\" procedure, described in clause 5.3.4.3, if\n    downlink packets arrive for the UE. In Control Plane CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation Downlink data triggers Mobile Terminated Data transport in\n    NAS signalling defined in clause\u00a05.3.4B.3.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  Based on operator policy any received Indication of \"Abnormal\n         Release of Radio Link\" may be used by Serving GW in subsequent\n         decisions to trigger PDN charging pause if the feature has been\n         enabled on that PDN.\n\n  4. The MME releases S1 by sending the S1 UE Context Release Command\n    (Cause) message to the eNodeB.\n\n  5. If the RRC connection is not already released, the eNodeB sends a RRC\n    Connection Release message to the UE in Acknowledged Mode. Once the\n    message is acknowledged by the UE, the eNodeB deletes the UE's context.\n\n  6. The eNodeB confirms the S1 Release by returning an S1 UE Context\n    Release Complete (ECGI, TAI, Secondary RAT usage data) message to the\n    MME. With this, the signalling connection between the MME and the\n    eNodeB for that UE is released. This step shall be performed promptly\n    after step\u00a04, e.g. it shall not be delayed in situations where the UE\n    does not acknowledge the RRC Connection Release.\n\n     If Dual Connectivity was active at the time of the release, the eNodeB\n    shall include the PSCell ID.\n\n     The eNodeB may include the Information On Recommended Cells And\n    eNodeBs For Paging in the S1 UE Context Release Complete message. If\n    available, the MME shall store this information to be used when paging\n    the UE.\n\n     The eNB includes Information for Enhanced Coverage, if available, in\n    the S1 UE Context Release Complete message.\n\n     If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage data reporting, the\n    eNodeB has not included Secondary RAT usage data at step\u00a01b, and the\n    eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the Secondary RAT usage\n    data is included in this message. If Secondary RAT usage data was\n    included at step\u00a01b then MME ignores Secondary RAT usage data at\n    step\u00a06.\n\n     The MME deletes any eNodeB related information (\"eNodeB Address in Use\n    for S1-MME\", \"MME UE S1 AP ID\" and \"eNB UE S1AP ID\") from the UE's MME\n    context, but, retains the rest of the UE's MME context including the S-\n    GW's S1-U configuration information (address and TEIDs). All non-GBR\n    EPS bearers established for the UE are preserved in the MME and in the\n    Serving GW.\n\n     If the cause of S1 release is because of User I inactivity, Inter-RAT\n    Redirection, the MME shall preserve the GBR bearers. If the cause of S1\n    release is because of CS Fallback triggered, further details about\n    bearer handling are described in TS\u00a023.272\u00a0[58]. Otherwise, e.g. Radio\n    Connection With UE Lost, S1 signalling connection lost, eNodeB failure\n    the MME shall trigger the MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation\n    procedure (clause\u00a05.4.4.2) for the GBR bearer(s) of the UE after the S1\n    Release procedure is completed.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  EPC does not support the GPRS preservation feature with setting\n         the MBR for GBR bearers to zero.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The MME can defer the deactivation of GBR bearers for a short\n         period (in the order of seconds) upon receipt of an S1AP UE Context\n         Release Request due to radio reasons, so as to allow the UE to re-\n         establish the corresponding radio and S1-U bearers and thus avoid\n         deactivation of the GBR bearers.\n\n     If LIPA is active for a PDN connection, the HeNB informs the\n    collocated L-GW by internal signalling to releases the direct user\n    plane path to the HeNB. After the direct user plane path is released,\n    if downlink packets arrive for the UE, the L-GW forwards the first\n    packet on the S5 tunnel to the S-GW to initiate the \"Network Triggered\n    Service Request\" procedure, as described in clause\u00a05.3.4.3.\n\n  7. If the eNodeB provided and MME accepted Secondary RAT usage data in\n    step\u00a06 (i.e. MME initiated S1 release), the MME initiates the Secondary\n    RAT usage data reporting procedure in clause\u00a05.7A.3 as illustrated in\n    figure 5.7A.3-2 (steps 7a - 7d). If PGW secondary RAT usage reporting\n    is active, steps 7b and 7c are performed, otherwise only steps 7a and\n    7d are performed.\n\n     If the eNodeB provided Secondary RAT usage data in step\u00a01b (i.e. eNB\n    initiated S1 release) and PGW secondary RAT usage data reporting is\n    active, the MME initiates the Secondary RAT usage data reporting\n    procedure in clause\u00a05.7A.3 as illustrated in figure 5.7A.3-2.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Connection Resume procedure", "numbering": "5.3.5A", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.3.5A Connection Resume procedure\n\nThis procedure is used by the UE to resume the ECM-connection if the UE and\nthe network support User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation and the UE has stored\nthe necessary information to conduct the Connection Resume procedure (see\nTS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]) otherwise the Service Request procedures are used, see\nclause\u00a05.3.4.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n          Figure 5.3.5A-1: UE initiated Connection Resume procedure\n\n  1.

If the UE has no activated PDN connection, then steps 2 to 10 are not\n    executed. If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage data\n    reporting, the MME shall wait for step\u00a011, if applicable, and shall\n    perform step\u00a012 before step\u00a02 onwards.

For PDN connections to the P-GW, the active EPS\n    Bearers in the Serving GW regarding this particular UE are deactivated\n    by the MME sending Delete Session Request (LBI, User Location\n    Information (ECGI), Secondary RAT usage data) per PDN connection to the\n    Serving GW. If ISR is activated, then the Serving GW shall not release\n    the Control Plane TEID allocated for MME/SGSN until it receives the\n    Delete Session Request message in step\u00a05.

When the S-GW receives the first Delete Session Request message from\n    the MME or SGSN in ISR activated state, the Serving GW deactivates ISR,\n    releases the related EPS Bearer context information and responds with\n    Delete Session Response (Cause).\n\n     When the S-GW receives the Delete Session Request message from the MME\n    or SGSN in ISR deactivated state, the Serving GW releases the related\n    EPS Bearer context information and jumps to step\u00a06 by sending a Delete\n    Session Request (LBI) message per PDN connection to the PDN GW. After\n    step\u00a07 the Serving GW responds back to the MME/SGSN with the Delete\n    Session Response (Cause and, optionally, APN Rate Control Status\n    according to clause\u00a04.7.7.3) message.\n\n  4.

If ISR is not\n    activated, this step shall be triggered by step\u00a02. This message\n    indicates that all bearers belonging to that PDN connection shall be\n    released.

If the\n    UE is in ECM-IDLE state the MME pages the UE.\n\n     For emergency attached UEs, MME initiated implicit detach procedures\n    are based on an inactivity timeout specific to emergency.\n\n     If this Detach procedure is due to the UE's Detach Request via a CSG\n    cell which the UE is not allowed to access, i.e. the CSG subscription\n    for this CSG ID and associated PLMN is absent or expired, the MME shall\n    send a Detach Request to UE with an appropriate cause indicating the UE\n    is not allowed to access this CSG.\n\n  2. If the UE has no activated PDN connection, then steps 2 to 10 are not\n    executed. If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the\n    MME shall wait for step\u00a011, if applicable, and perform step\u00a012 before\n    step\u00a02 onwards. For any PDN connections to the SCEF, the MME indicates\n    to the SCEF that the PDN connection for the UE is no longer available\n    according to TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] and steps 2 to 10 are not executed. For PDN\n    connections to the P-GW, any EPS Bearer Context information in the\n    Serving GW regarding this particular UE and related to the MME are\n    deactivated by the MME sending Delete Session Request (LBI, User\n    Location Information (ECGI), NAS Release Cause if available, Secondary\n    RAT usage data) message per PDN connection to the Serving GW. If the UE\n    Time Zone has changed, the MME includes the UE Time Zone IE in this\n    message. NAS Release Cause is only sent by the MME to the PDN GW if\n    this is permitted according to MME operator's policy. If Secondary RAT\n    usage data report was received from the RAN, the MME includes this in\n    the Delete Session Request message.\n\n  3. When the S-GW receives the first Delete Session Request message from\n    the MME or SGSN in ISR activated state, the Serving GW deactivates ISR,\n    releases the related EPS Bearer context information and responds with\n    Delete Session Response (Cause).\n\n     When the S-GW receives the Delete Session Request message from the MME\n    or SGSN in ISR deactivated state, the Serving GW releases the related\n    EPS Bearer context information and jumps to step\u00a06 by sending a Delete\n    Session Request (LBI) message to the PDN GW. After step\u00a07 the Serving\n    GW responds back to the MME/SGSN with the Delete Session Response\n    (Cause and, optionally, APN Rate Control Status according to\n    clause\u00a04.7.7.3) message.\n\n  4. If ISR is activated, MME sends Detach Notification (Cause) message to\n    the associated SGSN. The cause indicates whether it is a local or\n    complete detach.\n\n  5. If cause indicates complete detach then the SGSN sends a Delete\n    Session Request (LBI, CGI/SAI) message per PDN connection to the\n    Serving GW. If Cause indicates local detach then SGSN deactivates ISR\n    and steps\u00a05 to 9 shall be skipped. If the UE Time Zone has changed, the\n    SGSN includes the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\n\n  6. If ISR is activated, Serving GW deactivates ISR.\n\n     If ISR is not activated and the Serving GW received one or several\n    Delete Bearer Request message(s) from SGSN in step\u00a02, the Serving GW\n    sends a Delete Session Request (LBI, User Location Information (ECGI or\n    CGI/SAI), NAS Release Cause if available, Secondary RAT usage data)\n    message for each associated PDN connection to the PDN GW. NAS Release\n    Cause is the one received in the Delete Session Request from the MME.\n    This message indicates that all bearers belonging to that PDN\n    connection shall be released.\n\n     If the MME and/or SGSN send(s) UE's Location Information, and/or UE\n    Time Zone and/or Secondary RAT usage data in step\u00a02 and/or step\u00a05, the\n    S-GW includes the User Location Information, and/or UE Time Zone\n    Information with the least age in this message and/or Secondary RAT\n    usage data.\n\n  7. The PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause and,\n    optionally, APN Rate Control Status according to clause\u00a04.7.7.3)\n    message.\n\n  8. The PDN GW employs an IP-CAN Session Termination procedure as defined\n    in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] with the PCRF to indicate to the PCRF that the EPS\n    Bearer(s) are released if a PCRF is configured. If requested by the\n    PCRF the PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone\n    Information and NAS Release Cause (if available) to the PCRF as defined\n    in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  9. The Serving GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause, APN\n    Rate Control Status) message.\n\n  10.  The SGSN sends Detach Acknowledge message to the MME (APN Rate\n    Control Status). The MME stores the APN Rate Control Status in the MM\n    context.\n\n  11.  If the UE receives the Detach Request message from the MME in the\n    step 1, the UE sends a Detach Accept message to the MME any time after\n    step 1. The eNodeB forwards this NAS message to the MME along with the\n    TAI+ECGI of the cell which the UE is using.\n\n     If Dual Connectivity is active for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be\n    included in the Uplink NAS Transport that carries the Detach Accept\n    message.\n\n     If the UE receives Detach Request from the MME via a CSG cell with the\n    cause indicating the UE is not allowed to access this CSG, the UE shall\n    remove this CSG ID and associated PLMN from its Allowed CSG list, if\n    present.\n\n  12.  After receiving the Detach Accept message, Delete Session Response\n    and, if appropriate, Detach Acknowledge message, the MME releases the\n    S1-MME signalling connection for the UE by sending an S1 Release\n    Command (Cause) message to the eNodeB. The details of this step are\n    covered in the \"S1 Release Procedure\", as described in clause\u00a05.3.5 by\n    step\u00a04 to step\u00a06.

In that case the following steps 4-7 may be combined into\n    Network Triggered Service Request procedure or be performed stand-\n    alone. The MME checks if the UE can support the establishment of\n    additional user plane radio bearer based on the maximum number of user\n    plane radio bearers indicated by NB-IoT UE in the UE Network Capability\n    IE as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3 and for WB-E-UTRAN in clause\u00a04.12.\n\n     If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state and extended idle mode DRX is enabled\n    for the UE, the MME will trigger Network Triggered Service Request from\n    step\u00a03 (which is specified in clause\u00a05.3.4.3), and start a timer which\n    is configured to a value smaller than the GTP re-transmission timer. If\n    the MME receives no response from the UE before the timer expires, the\n    MME sends a Create Bearer Response with a rejection cause indicating\n    that the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving and, if a\n    Delay Tolerant Connection indication was set for the PDN connection,\n    the MME sets the internal flag Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection\n    Signalling.

The MME then builds a Session Management Request\n    including the PTI, TFT, EPS Bearer QoS parameters (excluding ARP),\n    Protocol Configuration Options, the EPS Bearer Identity, the Linked EPS\n    Bearer Identity (LBI) and a WLAN offloadability indication. If the UE\n    has UTRAN or GERAN capabilities and the network supports mobility to\n    UTRAN or GERAN, the MME uses the EPS bearer QoS parameters to derive\n    the corresponding PDP context parameters QoS Negotiated (R99 QoS\n    profile), Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id and TI and includes them in\n    the Session Management Request. If the UE indicated in the UE Network\n    Capability it does not support BSS packet flow procedures, then the MME\n    shall not include the Packet Flow Id. The MME then signals the Bearer\n    Setup Request (EPS Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, Maximum Packet Loss\n    Rate (UL, DL), Session Management Request, S1-TEID) message to the\n    eNodeB.\n\n     The MME may include an indication whether the traffic of this PDN\n    Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.23.\n\n  5. The eNodeB maps the EPS Bearer QoS to the Radio Bearer QoS. It then\n    signals a RRC Connection Reconfiguration (Radio Bearer QoS, Session\n    Management Request, EPS RB Identity) message to the UE. The UE shall\n    store the QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id and TI, which\n    it received in the Session Management Request, for use when accessing\n    via GERAN or UTRAN. The UE NAS stores the EPS Bearer Identity and links\n    the dedicated bearer to the default bearer indicated by the Linked EPS\n    Bearer Identity (LBI). The UE uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to\n    determine the mapping of traffic flows to the radio bearer. The UE may\n    provide the EPS Bearer QoS parameters to the application handling the\n    traffic flow. The application usage of the EPS Bearer QoS is\n    implementation dependent. The UE shall not reject the RRC Connection\n    Reconfiguration on the basis of the EPS Bearer QoS parameters contained\n    in the Session Management Request.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  How the eNB uses the Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) for\n         handover threshold decision, if provided, is out of scope of 3GPP\n         specifications.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The details of the Radio Bearer QoS are specified in\n         TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  6.

Upon reception of the Bearer Setup Response message in step 7 and\n    the Session Management Response message in step 9, the MME acknowledges\n    the bearer activation to the Serving GW by sending a Create Bearer\n    Response (EPS Bearer Identity, S1-TEID, User Location Information\n    (ECGI)) message.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW acknowledges the bearer activation to the PDN GW by\n    sending a Create Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, S5/S8-TEID, User\n    Location Information (ECGI)) message.\n\n  12.  If the dedicated bearer activation procedure was triggered by a PCC\n    Decision Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the\n    PCRF whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced\n    or not, allowing the completion of the PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session\n    Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session\n    Modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], after the\n    completion of IP-CAN bearer signalling. If requested by the PCRF the\n    PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone\n    Information to the PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If the dedicated bearer activation is rejected with a cause indicating\n    that the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving, then the\n    PDN GW re-attempts the same procedure after it receives the indication\n    that the is UE available for end to end signalling in the subsequent\n    Modify Bearer Request message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  The exact signalling of step 1 and 12 (e.g. for local break-out)\n         is outside the scope of this specification.

If dynamic PCC is deployed, the PCRF sends a PCC decision provision\n    (QoS policy) message to the PDN GW. This corresponds to the initial\n    steps of the PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or to\n    the PCRF response in the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\n    procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], up to the point that the PDN GW\n    requests IP-CAN Bearer Signalling. The PCC decision provision message\n    may indicate that User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone\n    Information is to be provided to the PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n    If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy.\n\n  2. The PDN GW uses this QoS policy to determine that the authorized QoS\n    of a service data flow has changed or that a service data flow shall be\n    aggregated to or removed from an active bearer. The PDN GW generates\n    the TFT and updates the EPS Bearer QoS to match the traffic flow\n    aggregate. The PDN GW then sends the Update Bearer Request (PTI, EPS\n    Bearer Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, APN-AMBR, TFT, Maximum Packet Loss\n    Rate (UL, DL)) message to the Serving GW. The Procedure Transaction Id\n    (PTI) parameter is used when the procedure was initiated by a UE\n    Requested Bearer Resource Modification Procedure - see clause\u00a05.4.5.\n    For APN-AMBR, the EPS bearer identity must refer to a non-GBR bearer.\n\n     For a QCI=1 bearer, the Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) may be\n    provided by the PDN GW as described in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  3. The Serving GW sends the Update Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer\n    Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, TFT, APN-AMBR, Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL,\n    DL)) message to the MME. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state the MME will\n    trigger the Network Triggered Service Request from step\u00a03 (which is\n    specified in clause\u00a05.3.4.3). In that case the following steps\u00a04-7 may\n    be combined into Network Triggered Service Request procedure or be\n    performed stand-alone. If only the QoS parameter ARP is modified and if\n    the UE is in ECM IDLE state the MME shall skip the Network Triggered\n    Service Request. In that case the following steps 4-9 are also skipped\n    and the MME sends an Update Bearer Response to the Serving GW.\n\n     If extended idle mode DRX is enabled for the UE, the MME will trigger\n    Network Triggered Service Request from step\u00a03 (which is specified in\n    clause\u00a05.3.4.3), and start a timer which is configured to a value\n    smaller than the GTP re-transmission timer. If the MME receives no\n    response from the UE before the timer expires, the MME sends an Update\n    Bearer Response with a rejection cause indicating that the UE is\n    temporarily not reachable due to power saving and, if a Delay Tolerant\n    Connection indication was set for the PDN connection, the MME sets the\n    internal flag Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling. The\n    rejection is forwarded by the Serving GW to the PDN GW. In this case,\n    the steps 4-11 are skipped.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If ISR is activated and the Serving GW does not have a downlink\n         S1-U and the SGSN has notified the Serving GW that the UE has moved\n         to PMM-IDLE or STANDBY state, the Serving GW sends Downlink Data\n         Notification to trigger MME and SGSN to page the UE (as specified\n         in clause\u00a05.3.4.3) before sending the Update Bearer Request\n         message.\n\n  4. The MME builds a Session Management Request including the PTI, EPS\n    Bearer QoS parameters (excluding ARP), TFT, APN-AMBR, EPS Bearer\n    Identity and a WLAN offloadability indication. If the UE has UTRAN or\n    GERAN capabilities and the network supports mobility to UTRAN or GERAN,\n    the MME uses the EPS Bearer QoS parameters to derive the corresponding\n    PDP context parameters QoS Negotiated (R99 QoS profile), Radio Priority\n    and Packet Flow Id and includes them in the Session Management Request.\n    If the UE indicated in the UE Network Capability it does not support\n    BSS packet flow procedures, then the MME shall not include the Packet\n    Flow Id. If the APN-AMBR has changed the MME may update the UE-AMBR if\n    appropriate. The MME then sends the Bearer Modify Request (EPS Bearer\n    Identity, EPS Bearer QoS, Session Management Request, UE-AMBR, Maximum\n    Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL)) message to the eNodeB.\n\n     The MME may include an indication whether the traffic of this PDN\n    Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.23.\n\n  5. The eNodeB maps the modified EPS Bearer QoS to the Radio Bearer QoS.\n    It then signals a RRC Connection Reconfiguration (Radio Bearer QoS,\n    Session Management Request, EPS RB Identity) message to the UE. The UE\n    shall store the QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id, which\n    it received in the Session Management Request, for use when accessing\n    via GERAN or UTRAN. If the APN-AMBR has changed, the UE stores the\n    modified APN-AMBR value and sets the MBR parameter of the corresponding\n    non-GBR PDP contexts (of this PDN connection) to the new value. The UE\n    uses the uplink packet filter (UL TFT) to determine the mapping of\n    traffic flows to the radio bearer. The UE may provide EPS Bearer QoS\n    parameters to the application handling the traffic flow(s). The\n    application usage of the EPS Bearer QoS is implementation dependent.\n    The UE shall not reject the Radio Bearer Modify Request on the basis of\n    the EPS Bearer QoS parameters contained in the Session Management\n    Request. The UE shall set its TIN to \"GUTI\" if the modified EPS bearer\n    was established before ISR activation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The details of the Radio Bearer QoS are specified in\n         TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  6. The UE acknowledges the radio bearer modification to the eNodeB with a\n    RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message.\n\n  7. The eNodeB acknowledges the bearer modification to the MME with a\n    Bearer Modify Response (EPS Bearer Identity) message. With this\n    message, the eNodeB indicates whether the requested EPS Bearer QoS\n    could be allocated or not.\n\n     The MME shall be prepared to receive this message either before or\n    after the Session Management Response message (sent in step\u00a09).\n\n  8. The UE NAS layer builds a Session Management Response including EPS\n    Bearer Identity. The UE then sends a Direct Transfer (Session\n    Management Response) message to the eNodeB.\n\n  9. The eNodeB sends an Uplink NAS Transport (Session Management Response)\n    message to the MME.\n\n  10.  Upon reception of the Bearer Modify Response message in step 7 and\n    the Session Management Response message in step 9, the MME acknowledges\n    the bearer modification to the Serving GW by sending an Update Bearer\n    Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information (ECGI))\n    message.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW acknowledges the bearer modification to the PDN GW by\n    sending an Update Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location\n    Information (ECGI)) message.\n\n  12.  If the Bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision\n    Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF\n    whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or\n    not by sending a Provision Ack message allowing the completion of the\n    PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or the PCEF\n    initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], after the completion of IP-CAN bearer signalling. If\n    requested by the PCRF the PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location Information\n    and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as defined in\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If the Bearer modification is rejected with a cause indicating that\n    the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving, then the PDN\n    GW re-attempts the same procedure after it receives the indication that\n    the is UE available for end to end signalling in the subsequent Modify\n    Bearer Request message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  The exact signalling of step 1 and 12 (e.g. for local break-out)\n         is outside the scope of this specification.

If the bearer modification procedure was triggered by a PCC Decision\n    Provision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to the PCRF\n    whether the requested PCC decision (QoS policy) could be enforced or\n    not by sending a Provision Ack message. This then allows the PCRF-\n    Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure or the PCEF initiated\n    IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] to\n    continue and eventually conclude, proceeding after the completion of IP-\n    CAN bearer signalling.

This procedure can be used to deactivate a dedicated\nbearer or deactivate all bearers belonging to a PDN address. If the default\nbearer belonging to a PDN connection is deactivated, the PDN GW deactivates\nall bearers belonging to the PDN connection.\n\nWhen the last bearer belonging to the last PDN connection of a given APN is\nreleased, the PGW may forward to the MME the APN Rate Control Status for\nstoring it in the MM context according to clause\u00a04.7.7.3.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n           Figure 5.4.4.1-1: PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Steps 3-8 are common for architecture variants with GTP based\n         S5/S8 and PMIP-based S5/S8.

If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW is triggered to initiate\n    the Bearer Deactivation procedure due either a QoS policy or on request\n    from the MME (as outlined in clause 5.4.4.2) or on intra-node\n    signalling request from the HeNB to release the LIPA PDN Connection.\n    Optionally, the PCRF sends QoS policy to the PDN GW. This corresponds\n    to the initial steps of the PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\n    procedure or the response to the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session\n    Modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], up to the point\n    that the PDN GW requests IP-CAN Bearer Signalling.

If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply\n    local QoS policy. The PDN GW initiated Bearer deactivation is also\n    performed when handovers occur from 3GPP to non-3GPP, in which case,\n    the default bearer and all the dedicated bearers associated with the\n    PDN address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.\n\n     For an emergency PDN connection the PDN GW initiates the deactivation\n    of all bearers of that emergency PDN connection when the PDN connection\n    is inactive (i.e. not transferring any packets) for a configured period\n    of time or when triggered by dynamic PCC.\n\n     For an PDN connection established towards the APN dedicated for\n    Restricted Local Operator Services, the PDN GW initiates the\n    deactivation of all bearers of the PDN connection per local operator\n    policy e.g when the duration of such PDN connection reaches a pre-\n    configured period of time.\n\n  2. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer Identity,\n    Causes and, optionally, APN Rate Control Status according to\n    clause\u00a04.7.7.3) message to the Serving GW. The Procedure Transaction Id\n    (PTI) parameter in this step and in the following steps is only used\n    when the procedure was initiated by a UE Requested Bearer Resource\n    Modification Procedure - see clause\u00a05.4.5. This message can include an\n    indication that all bearers belonging to that PDN connection shall be\n    released. The PDN GW includes 'Cause' IE in the Delete Bearer Request\n    message and sets the IE to 'RAT changed from 3GPP to Non-3GPP' if the\n    Delete Bearer Request message is caused by a handover from 3GPP to non-\n    3GPP.\n\n  3a.  The Serving GW sends the Delete Bearer Request (PTI, EPS Bearer\n    Identity, Cause and, optionally, APN Rate Control Status) message to\n    the MME. This message can include an indication that all bearers\n    belonging to that PDN connection shall be released.\n\n  3b.  If ISR is activated, the Serving GW sends the Delete Bearer Request\n    (PTI, EPS Bearer Identity, Cause) message to the SGSN. This message can\n    include an indication that all bearers belonging to that PDN connection\n    shall be released, and the SGSN releases all bearer resources of the\n    PDN connection.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If all the bearers belonging to a UE are released due to a\n         handover from 3GPP to non-3GPP, the SGSN changes the MM state of\n         the UE to IDLE (GERAN network) or PMM-DETACHED (UTRAN network).\n\n     If ISR is activated, upon receiving Delete Bearer Request from SGW for\n    the last PDN connection for a given UE, MME shall locally de-activate\n    ISR.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  In this case, SGSN locally de-activates ISR as well (see\n         TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]).\n\n     If received, the MME stores the APN Rate Control Status in the MM\n    context.\n\nSteps 4 to 7 are not performed if at least one of the following three\nconditions is fulfilled:\n\n  (i)  The UE is in ECM-IDLE and the last PDN connection of the UE is not\n    being deleted and the Delete Bearer Request received from the Serving\n    GW does not contain the cause \"reactivation requested\", which has been\n    sent from the PDN GW;\n\n  (ii) UE is in ECM-IDLE and the last PDN connection is deleted due to ISR\n    deactivation;\n\n  (iii)  UE is in ECM-IDLE and the last PDN connection is deleted in 3GPP\n    due to handover to non-3GPP access.\n\nWhen steps 4 to 7 are not performed, the EPS bearer state is synchronized\nbetween the UE and the network at the next ECM-IDLE to ECM-CONNECTED\ntransition (e.g. Service Request or TAU procedure).\n\n  4a.  If the last PDN connection of a UE that does not support \"Attach\n    without PDN connectivity\" is being released and the bearer deletion is\n    neither due to ISR deactivation nor due to handover to non-3GPP\n    accesses, the MME explicitly detaches the UE by sending a Detach\n    Request message to the UE. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state the MME\n    initiates paging via Network Triggered Service Request procedure in\n    clause\u00a05.3.4.3 from step\u00a03a onwards in order to inform UE of the\n    request. Steps\u00a04b to 7b are skipped in this case, and the procedure\n    continues from step\u00a07c.\n\n  4b.  If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state and the reason for releasing PDN\n    connection is \"reactivation requested\", the MME initiates paging via\n    Network Triggered Service Request procedure in clause\u00a05.3.4.3 from\n    step\u00a03a onwards in order to inform UE of the request and step\u00a04c is\n    performed after completion of the paging.\n\n  4c.  If the release of the bearer in E-UTRAN has already been signalled\n    to the MME, steps\u00a04c to  7 are omitted. Otherwise, if this is not the\n    last PDN connection for the UE which is being released, the MME sends\n    the S1-AP Deactivate Bearer Request (EPS Bearer Identity) message to\n    the eNodeB. The MME builds a NAS Deactivate EPS Bearer Context Request\n    message including the EPS Bearer Identity and a WLAN offloadability\n    indication, and includes it in the S1-AP Deactivate Bearer Request\n    message. When the bearer deactivation procedure was originally\n    triggered by a UE request, the NAS Deactivate EPS Bearer Context\n    Request message includes the PTI.\n\n     The MME may include an indication whether the traffic of this PDN\n    Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN as described in\n    clause\u00a04.3.23 if the PDN connection is not released.\n\n  5. The eNodeB sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message including\n    the EPS Radio Bearer Identity to release and the NAS Deactivate EPS\n    Bearer Context Request message to the UE.\n\n  6a.  The UE RRC releases the radio bearers indicated in the RRC message\n    in step 5, and indicates the radio bearer status to the UE NAS. Then\n    the UE NAS removes the UL TFTs and EPS Bearer Identity according to the\n    radio bearer status indication from the UE RRC. The UE responds to the\n    RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the eNodeB.\n\n  6b.  The eNodeB acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the MME with a\n    Deactivate Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, ECGI, TAI, PSCell ID,\n    Secondary RAT usage data) message. If the PLMN has configured secondary\n    RAT usage reporting and the eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to\n    report, the Secondary RAT usage data is included.\n\n     The PSCell ID is included if Dual Connectivity is active for the UE in\n    the RAN.\n\n     The MME shall be prepared to receive this message either before or\n    after the Session Management Response message sent in step\u00a07b, and\n    before or after, any Detach Request message sent in step\u00a07c.\n\n  7a The UE NAS layer builds a Deactivate EPS Bearer Context Accept message\n    including EPS Bearer Identity. The UE then sends a Direct Transfer\n    (Deactivate EPS Bearer Context Accept) message to the eNodeB.\n\n  7b.  The eNodeB sends an Uplink NAS Transport (Deactivate EPS Bearer\n    Context Accept) message to the MME.\n\n  7c.  If the UE receives the Detach Request message from the MME in the\n    step 4a, the UE sends a Detach Accept message to the MME any time after\n    step 4a. The eNodeB forwards this NAS message to the MME along with the\n    TAI+ECGI of the cell which the UE is using.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The UE may not be able to send this message, e.g. when the UE is\n         out of coverage of E-UTRAN due to mobility to non-3GPP access.\n\n  7a,b,c If Dual Connectivity is active for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be\n    included in the Uplink NAS Transport sent by the eNodeB.\n\n  8a.  After reception of both the Deactivate Bearer Response message in\n    step\u00a06b and the Deactivate EPS Bearer Context Accept message in\n    step\u00a07b, the MME deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated\n    EPS bearer and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the Serving GW\n    by sending a Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location\n    Information (ECGI), RAN/NAS Release Cause, Secondary RAT usage data)\n    message. If the MME received Secondary RAT usage data in step\u00a06b, the\n    MME shall include it in this message. If extended idle mode DRX is\n    enabled, then the MME acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the\n    Serving GW and at the same time the MME initiates the deactivation\n    towards the UE. If the S1 connection had already been released by the\n    eNB due to radio link failure and the MME receives a Delete Bearer\n    Request while it is still deferring the sending of the S1 release (see\n    clause\u00a05.3.5), the MME shall include in the Delete Bearer Response the\n    RAN/NAS Cause received in the S1 Release due to radio link failure\n    procedure.\n\n  8b The SGSN deletes PDP Context related to the deactivated EPS bearer and\n    acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the Serving GW by sending a\n    Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information\n    (CGI/SAI)) message. If extended idle mode DRX is enabled, then the SGSN\n    acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the Serving GW and at the same\n    time the SGSN initiates the deactivation towards the UE.\n\n  9. If ISR is activated, after receiving the two Delete Bearer Response\n    messages from the MME and the SGSN, or if ISR is not activated, after\n    receiving the Delete Bearer Response messages from the MME, the Serving\n    GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS bearer\n    acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by sending a Delete\n    Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location Information (ECGI\n    or CGI/SAI), Secondary RAT usage data) message. If the MME and/or SGSN\n    sent UE's Location Information and/or UE Time Zone in step\u00a08a and/or\n    step\u00a08b, the Serving GW includes the User Location Information and/or\n    UE Time Zone Information with the least age in this message. The\n    Serving GW includes the Secondary RAT usage data if it was received in\n    step\u00a08a and if PGW secondary RAT usage data reporting is active.\n\n  10.  The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS\n    bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by\n    receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to\n    the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced\n    by completing the PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure\n    or the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined\n    in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], proceeding after the completion of IP-CAN bearer\n    signalling. If requested by the PCRF the PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location\n    Information and/or UE Time Zone Information to the PCRF as defined in\n    TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6]. If available, the PDN GW shall send RAN/NAS Release\n    Cause to the PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  11.  If the UE is being explicitly detached, the MME releases the S1-MME\n    signalling connection for the UE by sending an S1 Release Command\n    (Cause) message to the eNodeB. The details of this step are covered in\n    the \"S1 Release Procedure\", as described in clause\u00a05.3.5 by step 4 to\n    step\u00a06.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  In the \"S1 Release Procedure\", if Dual Connectivity was active\n         at the time of the release, the eNodeB includes the PSCell ID.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  The exact signalling of step 1 and 10 (e.g. for local break-out)\n         is outside the scope of this specification. This signalling and its\n         interaction with the dedicated bearer activation procedure are to\n         be specified in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6]. Steps 1 and 10 are included here\n         only for completeness.\n\nIf all the bearers belonging to a UE that does not support \"Attach without\nPDN connectivity\" are released, the MME shall change the MM state of the UE\nto EMM-DEREGISTERED and the MME sends the S1 Release Command to the eNodeB,\nwhich initiates the release of the RRC connection for the given UE if it is\nnot released yet, and returns an S1 Release Complete message to the MME.\n\nIf all bearers of an emergency attached or RLOS attached UE are deactivated\nthe MME may initiate the explicit MME-Initiated Detach procedure.\nRegardless of the outcome of any explicit Detach procedure the MME changes\nthe EMM state of the UE to EMM-DEREGISTERED and the MME sends the S1\nRelease Command to the eNodeB if it is not yet released.\n\nIf the default bearer belonging to a PDN connection is deactivated, the MME\ndetermines the Maximum APN Restriction for the remaining PDN connections\nand stores this new value for the Maximum APN Restriction. In addition if\nISR is activated the SGSN determines the Maximum APN Restriction for the\nremaining bearer contexts and stores this new value for the Maximum APN\nRestriction.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation", "numbering": "5.4.4.2", "title_level": 3, "desc": "5.4.4.2  MME Initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation\n\nMME initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation is depicted in Figure 5.4.4.2-1\nbelow.

In case a downlink only traffic flow(s) is to be added the UE\n    shall provide an UL packet filter that effectively disallows any useful\n    packet flows (see clause\u00a015.3.3.4 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] for an example of\n    such packet filter).\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  Receiving at least one UL packet filter from the UE ensures that\n         a valid state for the TFT settings of the PDN connection as defined\n         in clause\u00a015.3.0 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] is maintained in case the TAD add\n         operation results in the establishment of a new dedicated EPS\n         bearer.\n\n     If the UE wants to change the GBR in addition, the UE includes the GBR\n    requirement of the EPS Bearer. The TAD is released when the procedure\n    is completed.\n\n     When only requesting for a modification of GBR (i.e. decrease or\n    increase), the TAD shall include the existing packet filter\n    identifier(s) for which the GBR change request applies to. The UE\n    includes the GBR requirement of the EPS Bearer. The TAD is released\n    when the procedure is completed.\n\n     When requesting for a modification of packet filter(s) (e.g. change of\n    port number), the TAD shall include packet filter identifier(s) for\n    which the change request applies to together with the changed packet\n    filter information.\n\n     If the UE requests for deletion of traffic flows, the TAD includes the\n    packet filter identifier(s) to be deleted. If the packet filters to be\n    deleted were mapped to a GBR Bearer, the UE includes the new GBR\n    requirement of the EPS Bearer.\n\n     The UE sends the Linked Bearer Id (LBI) only when the requested\n    operation is add, to indicate to which PDN connection the additional\n    bearer resource is linked to. The EPS Bearer Identity is only sent when\n    the requested operation is modify or delete. The Procedure Transaction\n    Id is dynamically allocated by the UE for this procedure. The UE should\n    ensure as far as possible that previously used PTI values are not\n    immediately reused. The PTI is released when the procedure is\n    completed. Protocol Configuration Options may be used to transfer\n    application level parameters between the UE and the PDN GW (see\n    TS\u00a023.228\u00a0[52]), and are sent transparently through the MME and the\n    Serving GW.\n\n     If the PDN GW indicated support for the 3GPP PS data off feature\n    during PDN connection setup, the UE shall include in the PCO the 3GPP\n    PS Data Off Support Indication, which indicates whether the user has\n    activated or deactivated 3GPP PS Data Off.\n\n  2. The MME sends the Bearer Resource Command (IMSI, LBI, PTI, EPS Bearer\n    Identity, QoS, TAD, Protocol Configuration Options) message to the\n    selected Serving GW. The MME validates the request using the Linked\n    Bearer Id. The same Serving GW address is used by the MME as for the\n    EPS Bearer identified by the Linked Bearer Id received in the Request\n    Bearer Resource Modification message.\n\n  3. The Serving GW sends the Bearer Resource Command (IMSI, LBI, PTI, EPS\n    Bearer Identity, QoS, TAD, Protocol Configuration Options) message to\n    the PDN GW. The Serving GW sends the message to the same PDN GW as for\n    the EPS Bearer identified by the Linked Bearer Id.\n\n  4. The PDN GW may either apply a locally configured QoS policy, or it may\n    interact with the PCRF to trigger the appropriate PCC decision, which\n    may take into account subscription information. This corresponds to the\n    beginning of a PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as\n    defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], up to the point that the PDN GW requests IP-\n    CAN Bearer Signalling. When interacting with PCRF, the PDN GW provides\n    to the PCRF the content of the TAD and, if applicable, the GBR change\n    (increase or decrease) associated with the packet filter information\n    contained in the TAD. The GBR change is either calculated from the\n    current Bearer QoS and the requested Bearer QoS from the UE, or set to\n    the requested GBR if the TAD indicates an add operation and no EPS\n    Bearer Identity was received. If the TAD indicates an add operation,\n    the requested QCI is also provided to the PCRF unless an existing\n    packet filter identifier is provided together with the new packet\n    filter.\n\n     The PCC decision provision message may indicate that User Location\n    Information and/or UE Time Zone information is to be provided to the\n    PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If the TAD operation is modify, delete, a request for changing the\n    GBR, or add with a link to existing packet filter(s), then the PDN GW\n    provides to the PCRF the SDF filter identifier(s), previously assigned\n    on Gx, that correspond to the received packet filter identifiers of the\n    EPS bearer indicated by the received EPS bearer identity.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The ability of the PCRF to handle multiple PCC rules in the same\n         request depends on operator policy. It is therefore recommended\n         that the UE avoids providing references to multiple packet filters\n         for different applications and services.\n\n     If the PDN GW detects that the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status has changed,\n    the PDN GW shall indicate this event to the charging system for offline\n    and online charging.\n\n     If the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status indicates that 3GPP PS Data Off is\n    activated for the UE, the PDN GW shall enforce the PCC rules for\n    downlink traffic to be applied when 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, as\n    described in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  5. If the request is accepted, either the Dedicated Bearer Activation\n    Procedure (according to clause\u00a05.4.1), the PDN GW Initiated Bearer\n    Deactivation Procedure (according to clause\u00a05.4.4.1) or one of the\n    Bearer Modification Procedures (according to clause\u00a05.4.2.1 or 5.4.3)\n    is invoked. The PTI allocated by the UE is used as a parameter in the\n    invoked Dedicated Bearer Activation Procedure, the PDN GW Initiated\n    Bearer Deactivation Procedure or the Bearer Modification Procedure to\n    correlate it to the UE Requested Bearer Resource Modification\n    Procedure. This provides the UE with the necessary linkage to what EPS\n    Bearer to be used for the new traffic flow aggregate. The PDN GW shall\n    not modify the QoS parameters requested by the UE.\n\n     The PDN GW inserts, modifies or removes packet filter(s) corresponding\n    to the TAD into the TFT for the EPS bearer. If PCC is in use, the PDN\n    GW uses the service data flow filters as specified in the resulting PCC\n    rule(s). The PDN GW validates the state of the TFT settings of the PDN\n    connection as defined in clause\u00a015.3.0 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. If after the\n    execution of all TAD operations the TFT of the dedicated EPS bearer\n    contains only packet filters for the downlink direction, the PDN GW\n    shall add a packet filter which effectively disallows any useful packet\n    flows in uplink direction (see clause\u00a015.3.3.4 in TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7] for an\n    example of such a packet filter) to the TFT.\n\n  NOTE\u00a04:  The PDN GW addition of an uplink packet filter allows the\n         handling of pre-Release 11 UEs which may have provided only\n         downlink packet filters in a TAD add operation without linking to\n         an existing packet filter.\n\n     When a new packet filter is inserted into a TFT, the PDN GW assigns a\n    new packet filter identifier which is unique within the TFT. The PDN GW\n    maintains the relation between the SDF filter identifier in the PCC\n    rule received from the PCRF and the packet filter identifier of the TFT\n    of this EPS bearer. If all of the packet filter(s) for a dedicated EPS\n    bearer have been removed from the TFT, the PDN GW performs the PDN GW\n    Initiated Bearer Deactivation Procedure.\n\n     If the requested QoS is not granted (i.e. the requested QoS cannot be\n    accepted or resources could not be allocated), or the resulting TFT\n    settings of the PDN connection does not pass the validation, then the\n    PDN GW sends a Bearer Resource Failure Indication (with a cause\n    indicating the reason why the request failed or was rejected) message,\n    which shall be delivered to the UE.\n\n  6. If the PDN GW interacted with the PCRF in step\u00a04, the PDN GW indicates\n    to the PCRF whether the PCC decision could be enforced or not. This\n    corresponds to the completion of the PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session\n    modification procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6], proceeding after\n    the completion of IP-CAN bearer signalling. If requested by the PCRF\n    the PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone\n    Information to the PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Void", "numbering": "5.4.6", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.4.6  Void\n\n\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "E-UTRAN initiated E-RAB modification procedure", "numbering": "5.4.7", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.4.7  E-UTRAN initiated E-RAB modification procedure\n\nWhen SCG bearer option is applied to support dual connectivity operation,\nthis procedure is used to transfer bearer contexts to and from Secondary\neNodeB (see TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]) or Secondary gNodeB (see TS\u00a037.340\u00a0[85]).

In these procedures the MME is\nunchanged. Two procedures are defined depending on whether the Serving GW\nis unchanged or is relocated. In addition to the X2 reference point between\nthe source and target eNodeB, the procedures rely on the presence of S1-MME\nreference point between the MME and the source eNodeB as well as between\nthe MME and the target eNodeB.\n\nThe handover preparation and execution phases are performed as specified in\nTS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. If emergency bearer services are ongoing for the UE handover\nto the target eNodeB is performed independent of the Handover Restriction\nList. The MME checks, as part of the Tracking Area Update in the execution\nphase, if the handover is to a restricted area and if so MME releases the\nnon-emergency bearers as specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\nIf the serving PLMN changes during X2-based handover, the source eNodeB\nshall indicate to the target eNodeB (in the Handover Restriction List) the\nPLMN selected to be the new Serving PLMN.\n\nWhen the UE receives the handover command it will remove any EPS bearers\nfor which it did not receive the corresponding EPS radio bearers in the\ntarget cell. As part of handover execution, downlink and optionally also\nuplink packets are forwarded from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB.\nWhen the UE has arrived to the target eNodeB, downlink data forwarded from\nthe source eNodeB can be sent to it. Uplink data from the UE can be\ndelivered via the (source) Serving GW to the PDN GW or optionally forwarded\nfrom the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB.

If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the source\n    eNodeB during the handover execution phase may provide RAN usage data\n    Report (Secondary RAT usage data, handover flag) to the MME. The source\n    eNB shall provide this only when the Target eNB has confirmed handover\n    over X2 interface (see TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] and the source eNB has sent a HO\n    command to the UE). The handover flag indicates to the MME that it\n    should buffer the usage data report before forwarding it to the Serving\n    GW.\n\n  1b.  The target eNodeB sends a Path Switch Request message to MME to\n    inform that the UE has changed cell, including the TAI+ECGI of the\n    target cell and the list of EPS bearers to be switched.\n\n     If Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be\n    included in the Path Switch Request message.\n\n     If the target cell is a CSG cell , the target eNodeB includes the CSG\n    ID of the target cell in Path Switch Request message. If the target\n    cell is in hybrid mode, it includes the CSG ID of the target cell and\n    CSG Access Mode set to \"hybrid\" in the Path Switch Request message.\n    Moreover, the Path Switch Request message contains the CSG Membership\n    Status IE if the hybrid cell accessed by the UE has a different CSG\n    from the source cell or the source cell does not have a CSG ID. The MME\n    determines the CSG membership based on the CSG ID and the target PLMN\n    id received from the target eNodeB.The MME updates the User CSG\n    information based on the CSG ID and CSG Access Mode received from the\n    target eNodeB and CSG membership if one of the parameters has changed.\n\n     For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW architecture, the\n    target eNodeB shall include the Local Home Network ID of the target\n    cell in the Path Switch Request message.\n\n     The MME determines that the Serving GW can continue to serve the UE.\n\n  2. The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request (eNodeB address(es) and TEIDs\n    for downlink user plane for the accepted EPS bearers, ISR Activated,\n    Secondary RAT usage data) message per PDN connection to the Serving GW\n    for each PDN connection where the default bearer has been accepted by\n    the target eNodeB. If the PDN GW requested location information change\n    reporting, the MME also includes the User Location Information IE in\n    this message if it is different compared to the previously sent\n    information. If the UE Time Zone has changed, the MME includes the UE\n    Time Zone IE in this message. If the Serving Network has changed, the\n    MME includes the new Serving Network IE in this message. If ISR was\n    activated before this procedure, MME should maintain ISR. The UE is\n    informed about the ISR status in the Tracking Area Update procedure. If\n    the Serving GW supports Modify Access Bearers Request procedure and if\n    there is no need for the SGW to send the signalling to the PDN GW, the\n    MME may send Modify Access Bearers Request (eNodeB address(es) and\n    TEIDs for downlink user plane for the accepted EPS bearers, ISR\n    Activated) per UE to the Serving GW to optimise the signalling. The MME\n    includes the Secondary RAT usage data if the MME received it from the\n    source eNodeB in step\u00a01a.\n\n     If the PDN GW requested UE's User CSG information (determined from the\n    UE context), the MME includes the User CSG Information IE in this\n    message if the User CSG Information has changed.\n\n     The MME uses the list of EPS bearers to be switched, received in\n    step\u00a01, to determine whether any dedicated EPS bearers in the UE\n    context have not been accepted by the target eNodeB. The MME releases\n    the non-accepted dedicated bearers by triggering the bearer release\n    procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2. If the Serving GW receives a\n    DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops the DL packet\n    and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the MME.\n\n     If the default bearer of a PDN connection has not been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB and there are multiple PDN connections active, the MME\n    shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed and release\n    that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN disconnection\n    procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n     If none of the default EPS bearers have been accepted by the target\n    eNodeB or there is a LIPA PDN connection that has not been released,\n    the MME shall act as specified in step\u00a06.\n\n  3. If the Serving GW has received the User Location Information IE and/or\n    the UE Time Zone IE and/or the Serving Network IE and/or User CSG\n    Information IE from the MME in step\u00a02 the Serving GW informs the PDN\n    GW(s) about this information that e.g. can be used for charging, by\n    sending the message Modify Bearer Request (Serving GW Address and TEID,\n    User Location Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE and/or Serving\n    Network IE and/or User CSG Information IE, Secondary RAT usage data)\n    per PDN connection to the PDN GW(s) concerned. The Serving GW shall\n    return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW address and TEID for uplink\n    traffic) message to the MME as a response to a Modify Bearer Request\n    message, or a Modify Access Bearers Response (Serving GW address and\n    TEID for uplink traffic) as a response to a Modify Access Bearers\n    Request message. If the Serving GW cannot serve the MME Request in the\n    Modify Access Bearers Request message without S5/S8 signalling or\n    without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8\n    interface, it shall respond to the MME with indicating that the\n    modifications are not limited to S1-U bearers, and the MME shall repeat\n    its request using Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection. The\n    Serving GW forwards the Secondary RAT usage data to the PDN GW, if the\n    Serving GW received it in step\u00a02 and if PGW secondary RAT usage data\n    reporting is active.\n\n  4. The Serving GW starts sending downlink packets to the target eNodeB\n    using the newly received address and TEIDs. A Modify Bearer Response\n    message is sent back to the MME.\n\n  5. In order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB, the\n    Serving GW shall send one or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path\n    immediately after switching the path as defined in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5],\n    clause\u00a010.1.2.2.\n\n  6. The MME confirms the Path Switch Request message with the Path Switch\n    Request Ack message. If the UE-AMBR is changed, e.g. all the EPS\n    bearers which are associated to the same APN are rejected in the target\n    eNodeB, the MME shall provide the updated value of UE-AMBR to the\n    target eNodeB in the Path Switch Request Ack message.\n\n     If the CSG membership status was included in the Path Switch Request\n    message, the MME shall include its verified CSG membership status in\n    the Path Switch Request Ack message.\n\n     If some EPS bearers have not been switched successfully in the core\n    network, the MME shall indicate in the Path Switch Request Ack message\n    which bearers failed to be established (see more detail in\n    TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]) and for dedicated bearers initiate the bearer release\n    procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2 to release the core network\n    resources of the failed dedicated EPS bearers. The target eNodeB shall\n    delete the corresponding bearer contexts when it is informed that\n    bearers have not been established in the core network.\n\n     If none of the default EPS bearers have been switched successfully in\n    the core network or if they have not been accepted by the target eNodeB\n    or the LIPA PDN connection has not been released, the MME shall send a\n    Path Switch Request Failure message (see more detail in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36])\n    to the target eNodeB. The MME performs explicit detach of the UE as\n    described in the MME initiated detach procedure of clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n     If the MME supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a and has UE Radio\n    Capability ID stored in the UE's context it includes it in the Path\n    Switch Request Ack message.\n\n  7. By sending Release Resource the target eNodeB informs success of the\n    handover to source eNodeB and triggers the release of resources. This\n    step is specified in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  8. The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure when one of the\n    conditions listed in clause \"Triggers for tracking area update\"\n    applies. If ISR is activated for the UE when the MME receives the\n    Tracking Area Update Request, the MME should maintain ISR by indicating\n    ISR Activated in the Tracking Area Update Accept message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  It is only a subset of the TA update procedure that is performed\n         by the MME, since the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED state and the MME is\n         not changed.\n\n\n5.5.1.1.3   X2-based handover with Serving GW relocation\n\nThis procedure is used to hand over a UE from a source eNodeB to a target\neNodeB using X2 when the MME is unchanged and the MME decides that the\nServing GW is to be relocated. The presence of IP connectivity between the\nsource Serving GW and the source eNodeB, between the source Serving GW and\nthe target eNodeB, and between the target Serving GW and target eNodeB is\nassumed. (If there is no IP connectivity between target eNodeB and source\nServing GW, it is assumed that the S1-based handover procedure in clause\n5.5.1.2 shall be used instead.)\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n      Figure 5.5.1.1.3-1: X2-based handover with Serving GW relocation\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined\n         in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].\n\n  1a.  If the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and\n    the source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the eNodeB\n    sends a RAN usage data Report (Secondary RAT usage data, handover flag)\n    message to the MME. The eNB shall provide this only when it is to\n    perform a Path Switch (i.e. the Target eNB has confirmed it is ready\n    over X2 interface (see TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5] and the source eNB has sent a HO\n    command to the UE). The handover flag indicates to the MME that it\n    should buffer the report before forwarding the Secondary RAT usage\n    charging data.\n\n  1b.  The target eNodeB sends a Path Switch Request message to MME to\n    inform that the UE has changed cell, including the ECGI of the target\n    cell and the list of EPS bearers to be switched.\n\n     If Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be\n    included in the Path Switch Request message.\n\n     If the target cell is a CSG cell, the target eNodeB includes the CSG\n    ID of the target cell in Path Switch Request message. If the target\n    cell is in hybrid mode, it includes the CSG ID of the target cell and\n    CSG Access Mode set to \"hybrid\" in the Path Switch Request message.\n    Moreover, the Path Switch Request message contains the CSG Membership\n    Status IE if the hybrid cell accessed by the UE has a different CSG\n    from the source cell or the source cell does not have a CSG ID. The MME\n    determines the CSG membership based on the CSG ID and the target PLMN\n    id received from the target eNodeB. The MME updates the User CSG\n    information based on the CSG ID and CSG Access Mode received from the\n    target eNodeB and CSG membership if one of the parameters has changed.\n\n     For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW architecture, the\n    target eNodeB shall include the Local Home Network ID of the target\n    cell in the Path Switch Request message.\n\n     The MME determines that the Serving GW is relocated and selects a new\n    Serving GW according to clause 4.3.8.2 on \"Serving GW Selection\n    Function\".\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The MME knows the S-GW Service Area with a TA granularity.\n\n  2. The MME sends a Create Session Request (bearer context(s) with PDN GW\n    addresses and TEIDs (for GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE keys (for PMIP-based\n    S5/S8) at the PDN GW(s) for uplink traffic, eNodeB address(es) and\n    TEIDs for downlink user plane for the accepted EPS bearers, the\n    Protocol Type over S5/S8, Serving Network, UE Time Zone, Secondary RAT\n    usage data) message per PDN connection to the target Serving GW for\n    each PDN connection where the default bearer has been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB. The target Serving GW allocates the S-GW addresses and\n    TEIDs for the uplink traffic on S1_U reference point (one TEID per\n    bearer). The Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which\n    protocol should be used over S5/S8 interface. If the PDN GW requested\n    location information change reporting, the MME also includes the User\n    Location Information IE in this message if it is different compared to\n    the previously sent information. If the PDN GW requested UE's User CSG\n    information (determined from the UE context), the MME includes the User\n    CSG Information IE in this message if the User CSG Information has\n    changed.\n\n     The MME uses the list of EPS bearers to be switched, received in\n    step\u00a01, to determine whether any dedicated EPS bearers in the UE\n    context have not been accepted by the target eNodeB. The MME releases\n    the non-accepted dedicated bearers by triggering the bearer release\n    procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2 via target Serving GW. If the\n    Serving GW receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving\n    GW drops the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data Notification\n    to the MME.\n\n     If the default bearer of a PDN connection has not been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB and there are multiple PDN connections active, the MME\n    shall consider all bearers of that PDN connection as failed and release\n    that PDN connection by triggering the MME requested PDN disconnection\n    procedure specified in clause\u00a05.10.3 via source Serving GW.\n\n     If none of the default EPS bearers have been accepted by the target\n    eNodeB or there is a LIPA PDN connection that has not been released,\n    the MME shall act as specified in step\u00a05.\n\n     If the MME received it from the source eNodeB in step\u00a01a and PDN GW\n    Secondary RAT reporting is active, the MME includes the Secondary RAT\n    usage data with a flag stating that the target SGW shall not process\n    the information and only forward it to the PDN GW.\n\n  3. The target Serving GW assigns addresses and TEIDs (one per bearer) for\n    downlink traffic from the PDN GW. The Serving GW allocates DL TEIDs on\n    S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers. It sends a Modify Bearer Request\n    (Serving GW addresses for user plane and TEID(s), Serving Network, PDN\n    Charging Pause Support Indication, Secondary RAT usage data) message\n    per PDN connection to the PDN GW(s). The S-GW also includes User\n    Location Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG\n    Information IE if it is present in step\u00a02. The PDN GW updates its\n    context field and returns a Modify Bearer Response (Charging Id,\n    MSISDN, PDN Charging Pause Enabled Indication (if PDN GW has chosen to\n    enable the function), etc.) message to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is\n    included if the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. The PDN GW\n    starts sending downlink packets to the target GW using the newly\n    received address and TEIDs. These downlink packets will use the new\n    downlink path via the target Serving GW to the target eNodeB. The\n    Serving GW shall allocate TEIDs for the failed bearers and inform to\n    the MME. The Serving GW forwards the Secondary RAT usage data to the\n    PDN GW, if the Serving GW received it in step\u00a02 and if PGW secondary\n    RAT usage data reporting is active.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path in\n    order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. The\n    source Serving GW shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the source\n    eNodeB.\n\n  4. The target Serving GW sends a Create Session Response (Serving GW\n    addresses and uplink TEID(s) for user plane) message back to the target\n    MME. The MME starts a timer, to be used in step 7.\n\n  5. The MME confirms the Path Switch Request message with the Path Switch\n    Request Ack (Serving GW addresses and uplink TEID(s) for user plane)\n    message. If the UE-AMBR is changed, e.g. all the EPS bearers which are\n    associated to the same APN are rejected in the target eNodeB, the MME\n    shall provide the updated value of UE-AMBR to the target eNodeB in the\n    Path Switch Request Ack message. The target eNodeB starts using the new\n    Serving GW address(es) and TEID(s) for forwarding subsequent uplink\n    packets.\n\n     If the CSG membership status was included in the Path Switch Request\n    message, the MME shall include its verified CSG membership status in\n    the Path Switch Request Ack message.\n\n     If some EPS bearers have not been switched successfully in the core\n    network, the MME shall indicate in the Path Switch Request Ack message\n    which bearers failed to be established (see more detail in\n    TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]) and for dedicated bearers initiate the bearer release\n    procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2 to release the core network\n    resources of the failed dedicated EPS bearers. The target eNodeB shall\n    delete the corresponding bearer contexts when it is informed that\n    bearers have not been established in the core network.\n\n     If none of the default EPS bearers have been switched successfully in\n    the core network or if they have not been accepted by the target eNodeB\n    or the LIPA PDN connection has not been released, the MME shall send a\n    Path Switch Request Failure message (see more detail in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36])\n    to the target eNodeB. The MME performs explicit detach of the UE as\n    described in the MME initiated detach procedure of clause\u00a05.3.8.3.\n\n     If the MME supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a and has UE Radio\n    Capability ID stored in the UE's context it includes it in the Path\n    Switch Request Ack message.\n\n  6. By sending Release Resource the target eNodeB informs success of the\n    handover to source eNodeB and triggers the release of resources. This\n    step is specified in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n  7. When the timer has expired after step 4, the source MME releases the\n    bearer(s) in the source Serving GW by sending a Delete Session Request\n    message (Cause, Operation Indication, Secondary RAT usage data). The\n    operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to the Source\n    Serving GW that the Source Serving GW shall not initiate a delete\n    procedure towards the PDN GW. The Source Serving GW acknowledges with\n    Delete Session Response messages. If ISR has been activated before this\n    procedure, the cause indicates to the Source S-GW that the Source S-GW\n    shall delete the bearer resources on the other old CN node by sending\n    Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN node. The MME includes the\n    Secondary RAT usage data in this message if it received it in step\u00a01a.\n\n  8. The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure when one of the\n    conditions listed in clause \"Triggers for tracking area update\"\n    applies.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  It is only a subset of the TA update procedure that is performed\n         by the MME, since the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED state. The UE is\n         informed about the ISR status in the Tracking Area Update\n         procedure.\n\n\n5.5.1.2  S1-based handover\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "General", "numbering": "5.5.1.2.1", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "S-based handover, normal", "numbering": "5.5.1.2.2", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "S-based handover, Reject", "numbering": "5.5.1.2.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "S-based handover, Cancel", "numbering": "5.5.1.2.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.1.2.1   General\n\nThe S1-based handover procedure is used when the X2-based handover cannot\nbe used. The source eNodeB initiates a handover by sending Handover\nRequired message over the S1-MME reference point. This procedure may\nrelocate the MME and/or the Serving GW. The source MME selects the target\nMME. The MME should not be relocated during inter-eNodeB handover unless\nthe UE leaves the MME Pool Area where the UE is served. The MME (target MME\nfor MME relocation) determines if the Serving GW needs to be relocated. If\nthe Serving GW needs to be relocated the MME selects the target Serving GW,\nas specified in clause\u00a04.3.8.2 on Serving GW selection function.\n\nThe source eNodeB decides which of the EPS bearers are subject for\nforwarding of downlink and optionally also uplink data packets from the\nsource eNodeB to the target eNodeB. The EPC does not change the decisions\ntaken by the RAN node. Packet forwarding can take place either directly\nfrom the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB, or indirectly from the source\neNodeB to the target eNodeB via the source and target Serving GWs (or if\nthe Serving GW is not relocated, only the single Serving GW).\n\nThe availability of a direct forwarding path is determined in the source\neNodeB and indicated to the source MME. If X2 connectivity is available\nbetween the source and target eNodeBs, a direct forwarding path is\navailable.\n\nIf a direct forwarding path is not available, indirect forwarding may be\nused. The source MME uses the indication from the source eNodeB to\ndetermine whether to apply indirect forwarding. The source MME indicates to\nthe target MME whether indirect forwarding should apply. Based on this\nindication, the target MME determines whether it applies indirect\nforwarding.\n\nIf the MME receives a rejection to an S1 interface procedure (e.g.\ndedicated bearer establishment/modification/release; location reporting\ncontrol; NAS message transfer; etc.) from the eNodeB with an indication\nthat an S1 handover is in progress (see TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]), the MME shall\nreattempt the same S1 interface procedure when either the handover is\ncomplete or is deemed to have failed if the MME is still the serving MME,\nexcept in case of Serving GW relocation. If the S1 handover changes the\nserving MME, the source MME shall terminate any other ongoing S1 interface\nprocedures except the handover procedure.\n\nIf the S1 handover includes the Serving GW relocation, and if the MME\nreceives a rejection to a NAS message transfer for a Downlink NAS Transport\nor Downlink Generic NAS Transport message from the eNodeB with an\nindication that an S1 handover is in progress, the MME should resend the\ncorresponding message to the target eNodeB when either the handover is\ncomplete or to the source eNodeB when the handover is deemed to have failed\nif the MME is still the serving MME.\n\nIf the MME receives a rejection to a NAS message transfer for a CS Service\nNotification or to a UE Context modification Request message with a CS\nFallback indication from the eNodeB with an indication that an S1 handover\nis in progress, the MME shall resend the corresponding message to the\ntarget eNodeB when either the handover is complete or to the source eNodeB\nwhen the handover is deemed to have failed if the MME is still the serving\nMME.\n\nIn order to minimise the number of procedures rejected by the eNodeB, the\nMME should pause non-handover related S1 interface procedures (e.g.\ndownlink NAS message transfer, E-RAB Setup/Modify/Release, etc.) while a\nhandover is ongoing (i.e. from the time that a Handover Required has been\nreceived until either the Handover procedure has succeeded (Handover\nNotify) or failed (Handover Failure)) and continue them once the Handover\nprocedure has completed if the MME is still the serving MME, except in case\nof Serving GW relocation.\n\nIf during the handover procedure the MME detects that the Serving GW or/and\nthe MME needs be relocated, the MME shall reject any PDN GW initiated EPS\nbearer(s) request received since handover procedure started and shall\ninclude an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to\nhandover procedure in progress. The rejection is forwarded by the Serving\nGW to the PDN GW, with the indication that the request has been temporarily\nrejected.\n\nUpon reception of a rejection for an EPS bearer(s) PDN GW initiated\nprocedure with an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected\ndue to handover procedure in progress, the PDN GW start a locally\nconfigured guard timer. The PDN GW shall re-attempt, up to a pre-configured\nnumber of times, when either it detects that the handover is completed or\nhas failed using message reception or at expiry of the guard timer.\n\nIf emergency bearer services are ongoing for the UE, handover to the target\neNodeB is performed independent of the Handover Restriction List. The MME\nchecks, as part of the Tracking Area Update in the execution phase, if the\nhandover is to a restricted area and if so MME releases the non-emergency\nbearers as specified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\nIf emergency bearer services are ongoing for the UE, handover to the target\nCSG cell is performed independent of the UE's CSG subscription. If the\nhandover is to a CSG cell that the UE is not subscribed, the target eNodeB\nonly accepts the emergency bearers and the target MME releases the non-\nemergency PDN connections that were not accepted by the target eNodeB as\nspecified in clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\nFor inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the source MME has the CSG-ID\nlist of the target PLMN, the source MME shall use it to validate the CSG\nmembership of the UE in the target CSG cell. Otherwise, based on operator's\nconfiguration the source MME may allow the handover by validating the CSG\nmembership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG-ID list of the\nregistered PLMN-ID. If neither the CSG-ID list of the target PLMN nor the\noperator's configuration permits the handover,the source MME shall reject\nthe handover due to no CSG membership information of the target PLMN-ID.\n\nAs specified in clause\u00a04.3.8.3, with regard to CIoT EPS Optimisations, the\nsource MME attempts to perform handover to a target MME that can support\nthe UE's Preferred Network Behaviour. For a UE that is using a Non-IP\nconnection to a PDN Gateway, or a PDN connection to a SCEF, if these\nbearers cannot be supported by the target MME, the source MME does not\nattempt to handover those bearers, but instead releases them upon\nsuccessful completion of the handover. If the MME does not have any bearer\nfor the UE that can be transferred, then the MME sends an S1-AP Handover\nPreparation Failure message to the source eNB.\n\nFor PDN connection of Ethernet Type, if the target MME does not support\nEthernet PDN Type, the source MME does not attempt to handover those\nbearers, but instead releases them upon successful completion of the\nhandover.\n\n  NOTE:  Inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an\n         equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported.\n\nIf the source eNodeB and target eNodeB support RACS as defined in\nclause\u00a05.11.3a, the Source to Target transparent container shall contain\nthe UE's UE Radio Capability ID.\n\n\n5.5.1.2.2   S1-based handover, normal\n\nThis procedure describes the S1-based handover in the normal case,\nclause\u00a05.5.1.2.3 describes it when the procedure is rejected by the target\neNodeB or the target MME and clause\u00a05.5.1.2.4 describes when the procedure\nis canceled by the source eNodeB.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                    Figure 5.5.1.2.2-1: S1-based handover\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined\n         in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2]. Steps 16 and 16a concern GTP based S5/S8.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the Serving GW is not relocated, the box \"Source Serving GW\"\n         in figure 5.5.1.2.2-1 is acting as the target Serving GW.\n\n  1. The source eNodeB decides to initiate an S1-based handover to the\n    target eNodeB. This can be triggered e.g. by no X2 connectivity to the\n    target eNodeB, or by an error indication from the target eNodeB after\n    an unsuccessful X2-based handover, or by dynamic information learnt by\n    the source eNodeB.\n\n  2. The source eNodeB sends Handover Required (Direct Forwarding Path\n    Availability, Source to Target transparent container, target eNodeB\n    Identity, CSG ID, CSG access mode, target TAI, S1AP Cause) to the\n    source MME. The source eNodeB indicates which bearers are subject to\n    data forwarding. Direct Forwarding Path Availability indicates whether\n    direct forwarding is available from the source eNodeB to the target\n    eNodeB. This indication from source eNodeB can be based on e.g. the\n    presence of X2. The target TAI is sent to MME to facilitate the\n    selection of a suitable target MME. When the target cell is a CSG cell\n    or a hybrid cell, the source eNodeB shall include the CSG ID of the\n    target cell. If the target cell is a hybrid cell, the CSG access mode\n    shall be indicated.\n\n  3. The source MME selects the target MME as described in clause 4.3.8.3\n    on \"MME Selection Function\" and if it has determined to relocate the\n    MME, it sends a Forward Relocation Request (MME UE context, Source to\n    Target transparent container, RAN Cause, target eNodeB Identity, CSG\n    ID, CSG Membership Indication, target TAI, MS Info Change Reporting\n    Action (if available), CSG Information Reporting Action (if available),\n    UE Time Zone, Direct Forwarding Flag, Serving Network, Local Home\n    Network ID, LTE-M UE Indication) message to the target MME. The target\n    TAI is sent to the target MME to help it to determine whether S-GW\n    relocation is needed (and, if needed, aid SGW selection). The old\n    Serving Network is sent to target MME to support the target MME to\n    resolve if Serving Network is changed.  In network sharing scenarios\n    Serving Network denotes the serving core network.\n\n     The source MME shall perform access control by checking the UE's CSG\n    subscription when CSG ID is provided by the source eNodeB. If there is\n    no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription is\n    expired, and the target cell is a CSG cell, the source MME shall reject\n    the handover with an appropriate cause unless the UE has emergency\n    bearer services.\n\n     The MME UE context includes IMSI, ME Identity, UE security context, UE\n    Network Capability, AMBR, Selected CN operator ID, APN restriction,\n    Serving GW address and TEID for control signalling, and EPS Bearer\n    context(s).\n\n     An EPS Bearer context includes the PDN GW addresses and TEIDs (for GTP-\n    based S5/S8) or GRE keys (for PMIP-based S5/S8) at the PDN GW(s) for\n    uplink traffic, APN, Serving GW addresses and TEIDs for uplink traffic,\n    and TI.\n\n     Based on the CIoT EPS Optimisation capabilities of the target MME\n    (determined according to the target MME selection procedure of\n    clause\u00a04.3.8.3) the source MME only includes the EPS Bearer Context(s)\n    that the target MME can support. If none of the UE's EPS Bearers can be\n    supported by the selected target MME, the source MME rejects the S1\n    handover attempt by sending a Handover Preparation Failure (Cause)\n    message to the Source eNodeB. If the target MME supports CIoT EPS\n    Optimisation and the use of header compression has been negotiated\n    between the UE and the source MME, the source MME also includes in the\n    Forward Relocation Request the previously negotiated Header Compression\n    Configuration that includes the information necessary for the ROHC\n    channel setup but not the RoHC context itself.\n\n     If the source MME includes EPS Bearer Context, in addition to the\n    Serving GW IP address and TEID for S1-U use plane, the source MME also\n    includes Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U, if available.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If the handover is successful, the source MME will signal to the\n         SGW and/or SCEF to release any non-included EPS Bearers after\n         step\u00a014. The non-included bearers are locally released by the UE\n         following the Bearer Context Status synchronisation that occurs\n         during the Tracking Area Update at step\u00a018.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW the source MME shall include the Local\n    Home Network ID of the source cell in the EPS Bearer context\n    corresponding to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n     RAN Cause indicates the S1AP Cause as received from source eNodeB.\n\n     The source MME includes the CSG ID in the Forward Relocation Request\n    when the target cell is a CSG or hybrid cell. When the target cell is a\n    hybrid cell, or if there are one or several emergency bearers and the\n    target cell is a CSG cell, the CSG Membership Indication indicating\n    whether the UE is a CSG member shall be included in the Forward\n    Relocation Request message.\n\n     The Direct Forwarding Flag indicates if direct forwarding is applied,\n    or if indirect forwarding is going to be set up by the source side.\n\n     The target MME shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on\n    the APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Forward Relocation\n    Request, and shall subsequently store the new Maximum APN restriction\n    value.\n\n     If the UE receives only emergency services and the UE is UICCless,\n    IMSI can not be included in the MME UE context in Forward Relocation\n    Request message. For emergency attached UEs, if the IMSI cannot be\n    authenticated, then the IMSI shall be marked as unauthenticated. Also,\n    in this case, security parameters are included only if available.\n\n     If a UE is RLOS attached, the old MME includes an RLOS indication to\n    the new MME. If the RLOS attached UE in the old MME does not have a\n    USIM, IMSI can not be included in the Forward Relocation Request\n    message. If the RLOS attached UE has USIM but the IMSI cannot be\n    successfully authenticated, then the IMSI shall be marked as\n    unauthenticated. Also, in this case, security parameters are included\n    only if available.\n\n     If the Old MME is aware the UE is a LTE-M UE, it provides the LTE-M UE\n    Indication to the new MME.\n\n  4. If the MME has been relocated, the target MME verifies whether the\n    source Serving GW can continue to serve the UE. If not, it selects a\n    new Serving GW as described in clause 4.3.8.2 on \"Serving GW Selection\n    Function\". If the MME has not been relocated, the source MME decides on\n    this Serving GW re-selection.\n\n     If the source Serving GW continues to serve the UE, no message is sent\n    in this step. In this case, the target Serving GW is identical to the\n    source Serving GW.\n\n     If a new Serving GW is selected, the target MME sends a Create Session\n    Request (bearer context(s) with PDN GW addresses and TEIDs (for GTP-\n    based S5/S8) or GRE keys (for PMIP-based S5/S8) at the PDN GW(s) for\n    uplink traffic, Serving Network, UE Time Zone) message per PDN\n    connection to the target Serving GW. The target Serving GW allocates\n    the S-GW addresses and TEIDs for the uplink traffic on S1_U reference\n    point (one TEID per bearer). The target Serving GW sends a Create\n    Session Response (Serving GW addresses and uplink TEID(s) for user\n    plane) message back to the target MME.\n\n  5. The Target MME sends Handover Request (EPS Bearers to Setup, AMBR,\n    S1AP Cause, Source to Target transparent container, CSG ID, CSG\n    Membership Indication, Handover Restriction List, UE Radio Capability\n    ID) message to the target eNodeB. This message creates the UE context\n    in the target eNodeB, including information about the bearers, and the\n    security context. For each EPS Bearer, the Bearers to Setup includes\n    Serving GW address and uplink TEID for user plane, and EPS Bearer QoS.\n    If the direct forwarding flag indicates unavailability of direct\n    forwarding and the target MME knows that there is no indirect data\n    forwarding connectivity between source and target, the Bearers to Setup\n    shall include \"Data forwarding not possible\" indication for each EPS\n    bearer. Handover Restriction List is sent if available in the Target\n    MME; it is described in clause 4.3.5.7 \"Mobility Restrictions\".\n\n     S1AP Cause indicates the RAN Cause as received from source MME.\n\n     The Target MME shall include the CSG ID and CSG Membership Indication\n    when provided by the source MME in the Forward Relocation Request\n    message.\n\n     The target eNodeB sends a Handover Request Acknowledge (EPS Bearer\n    Setup list, EPS Bearers failed to setup list Target to Source\n    transparent container) message to the target MME. The EPS Bearer Setup\n    list includes a list of addresses and TEIDs allocated at the target\n    eNodeB for downlink traffic on S1-U reference point (one TEID per\n    bearer) and addresses and TEIDs for receiving forwarded data if\n    necessary. If the UE-AMBR is changed, e.g. all the EPS bearers which\n    are associated to the same APN are rejected in the target eNodeB, the\n    MME shall recalculate the new UE-AMBR and signal the modified UE-AMBR\n    value to the target eNodeB.\n\n     If none of the default EPS bearers have been accepted by the target\n    eNodeB, the target MME shall reject the handover as specified in\n    clause\u00a05.5.1.2.3.\n\n     If the target cell is a CSG cell, the target eNodeB shall verify the\n    CSG ID provided by the target MME, and reject the handover with an\n    appropriate cause if it does not match the CSG ID for the target cell.\n    If the target eNodeB is in hybrid mode, it may use the CSG Membership\n    Indication to perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG\n    members. If the target cell is a CSG cell, and if the CSG Membership\n    Indication is \"non member\", the target eNodeB only accepts the\n    emergency bearers.\n\n     If the MME supports RACS as defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a and has UE Radio\n    Capability ID stored in the UE's context it includes it in the Handover\n    Request message.\n\n  6. If indirect forwarding applies and the Serving GW is relocated, the\n    target MME sets up forwarding parameters by sending Create Indirect\n    Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (target eNodeB addresses and TEIDs for\n    forwarding) to the Serving GW. The Serving GW sends a Create Indirect\n    Data Forwarding Tunnel Response (target Serving GW addresses and TEIDs\n    for forwarding) to the target MME. If the Serving GW is not relocated,\n    indirect forwarding may be set up in step\u00a08 below.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  7. If the MME has been relocated, the target MME sends a Forward\n    Relocation Response (Cause, Target to Source transparent container,\n    Serving GW change indication, EPS Bearer Setup List, Addresses and\n    TEIDs) message to the source MME. For indirect forwarding, this message\n    includes Serving GW Address and TEIDs for indirect forwarding (source\n    or target). Serving GW change indication indicates a new Serving GW has\n    been selected.\n\n  8. If indirect forwarding applies, the source MME sends Create Indirect\n    Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (addresses and TEIDs for forwarding) to\n    the Serving GW. If the Serving GW is relocated it includes the tunnel\n    identifier to the target serving GW.\n\n     The Serving GW responds with a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Response (Serving GW addresses and TEIDs for forwarding) message to the\n    source MME.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  9. The source MME sends a Handover Command (Target to Source transparent\n    container, Bearers subject to forwarding, Bearers to Release) message\n    to the source eNodeB. The Bearers subject to forwarding includes list\n    of addresses and TEIDs allocated for forwarding. The Bearers to Release\n    includes the list of bearers to be released.\n\n  9a.  The Handover Command is constructed using the Target to Source\n    transparent container and is sent to the UE. Upon reception of this\n    message the UE will remove any EPS bearers for which it did not receive\n    the corresponding EPS radio bearers in the target cell.\n\n  9b.  If the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and\n    the source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the eNodeB\n    sends a RAN Usage data Report (Secondary RAT usage data, handover flag)\n    message to the source MME. The handover flag indicates to the MME that\n    it should buffer the report before forwarding the Secondary RAT usage\n    data.\n\n  10.  The source eNodeB sends the eNodeB Status Transfer message to the\n    target eNodeB via the MME(s) to convey the PDCP and HFN status of the E-\n    RABs for which PDCP status preservation applies, as specified in\n    TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. The source eNodeB may omit sending this message if none\n    of the E-RABs of the UE shall be treated with PDCP status preservation.\n\n     If there is an MME relocation the source MME sends this information to\n    the target MME via the Forward Access Context Notification message\n    which the target MME acknowledges. The source MME or, if the MME is\n    relocated, the target MME, sends the information to the target eNodeB\n    via the MME Status Transfer message.\n\n  11.  The source eNodeB should start forwarding of downlink data from the\n    source eNodeB towards the target eNodeB for bearers subject to data\n    forwarding. This may be either direct (step 11a) or indirect forwarding\n    (step 11b).\n\n  12.  After the UE has successfully synchronized to the target cell, it\n    sends a Handover Confirm message to the target eNodeB. Downlink packets\n    forwarded from the source eNodeB can be sent to the UE. Also, uplink\n    packets can be sent from the UE, which are forwarded to the target\n    Serving GW and on to the PDN GW.\n\n  13.  The target eNodeB sends a Handover Notify (TAI+ECGI, Local Home\n    Network ID) message to the target MME. If Dual Connectivity is\n    activated for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be included in the Handover\n    Notify message.\n\n     For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW architecture, the\n    target eNodeB shall include the Local Home Network ID of the target\n    cell in the Handover Notify message.\n\n  14.  If the MME has been relocated, the target MME sends a Forward\n    Relocation Complete Notification message to the source MME. The source\n    MME in response sends a Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge\n    (Secondary RAT usage data) message to the target MME. The source MME\n    includes Secondary RAT usage data in this message if it received this\n    in step\u00a09b. Regardless if MME has been relocated or not, a timer in\n    source MME is started to supervise when resources in Source eNodeB and\n    if the Serving GW is relocated, also resources in Source Serving GW\n    shall be released.\n\n     Upon receipt of the Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge message\n    the target MME starts a timer if the target MME allocated S-GW\n    resources for indirect forwarding.\n\n     For all bearers that were not included in the Forward Relocation\n    Request message sent in step\u00a03, the MME now releases them by sending a\n    Delete Bearer Command to the SGW, or, the appropriate message to the\n    SCEF.\n\n  15.  The MME sends a Modify Bearer Request (eNodeB address and TEID\n    allocated at the target eNodeB for downlink traffic on S1-U for the\n    accepted EPS bearers, ISR Activated, Secondary RAT usage data if PGW\n    secondary RAT usage data reporting is active) message to the target\n    Serving GW for each PDN connection, including the PDN connections that\n    need to be released. If the PDN GW requested location information\n    change reporting and/or User CSG information (determined from the UE\n    context), the MME also includes the User Location Information IE (if it\n    is different compared to the previously sent information) and/or User\n    CSG Information IE in this message. If the UE Time Zone has changed,\n    the MME includes the UE Time Zone IE in this message. If Serving GW is\n    not relocated but the Serving Network has changed or if the MME has not\n    received any old Serving Network information from the old MME, the MME\n    includes the Serving Network IE in this message. For the case that\n    neither MME nor S-GW changed, if ISR was activated before this\n    procedure MME should maintain ISR. The UE is informed about the ISR\n    status in the Tracking Area Update procedure. If the Serving GW\n    supports Modify Access Bearers Request procedure and if there is no\n    need for the SGW to send the signalling to the PDN GW, the MME may send\n    Modify Access Bearers Request (eNodeB address and TEID allocated at the\n    target eNodeB for downlink traffic on S1 U for the accepted EPS\n    bearers, ISR Activated) per UE to the Serving GW to optimise the\n    signalling. If Serving GW is not relocated and if Secondary RAT usage\n    data was received in step\u00a09a, the MME includes the Secondary RAT usage\n    data in the message. If the Serving GW has been relocated and if PGW\n    Secondary RAT reporting is active, the MME includes the Secondary RAT\n    usage data and also includes a flag stating that the Serving GW should\n    not process the information and only forward it to the PDN GW.\n\n     The MME releases the non-accepted dedicated bearers by triggering the\n    bearer release procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2. If the Serving\n    GW receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops\n    the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the\n    MME.\n\n     If the default bearer of a PDN connection has not been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB and there are other PDN connections active, the MME shall\n    handle it in the same way as if all bearers of a PDN connection have\n    not been accepted. The MME releases these PDN connections by triggering\n    the MME requested PDN disconnection procedure specified in\n    clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n     When the Modify Bearer Request does not indicate ISR Activated the\n    Serving GW deletes any ISR resources by sending a Delete Bearer Request\n    to the other CN node that has bearer resources on the Serving GW\n    reserved.\n\n  16.  If the Serving GW is relocated, the target Serving GW assigns\n    addresses and TEIDs (one per bearer) for downlink traffic from the PDN\n    GW. It sends a Modify Bearer Request (Serving GW addresses for user\n    plane and TEID(s), Serving Network, PDN Charging Pause Support\n    Indication, Secondary RAT usage data) message per PDN connection to the\n    PDN GW(s). The S-GW also includes User Location Information IE and/or\n    UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE if they are present in\n    step\u00a015. The Serving GW also includes Serving Network IE if it is\n    present in step\u00a04 or step\u00a015. The Serving GW allocates DL TEIDs on\n    S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers. The PDN GW updates its context\n    field and returns a Modify Bearer Response (Charging Id, MSISDN, PDN\n    Charging Pause Enabled Indication (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the\n    function), etc.) message to the target Serving GW. The MSISDN is\n    included if the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. The PDN GW\n    starts sending downlink packets to the target GW using the newly\n    received address and TEIDs. These downlink packets will use the new\n    downlink path via the target Serving GW to the target eNodeB. The\n    Secondary RAT usage data is included if it was received in step\u00a015 and\n    if PGW secondary RAT usage data reporting is active.\n\n     If the Serving GW is not relocated, but has received the User Location\n    Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE\n    and/or Serving Network IE from the MME in step\u00a015, the Serving GW shall\n    inform the PDN GW(s) about these information that e.g. can be used for\n    charging, by sending the message Modify Bearer Request (User Location\n    Information IE, UE Time Zone IE, User CSG Information IE, Serving\n    Network IE) to the PDN GW(s) concerned. A Modify Bearer Response\n    message is sent back to the Serving GW.\n\n     If the Serving GW is not relocated and it has not received User\n    Location Information IE nor UE Time Zone IE nor User CSG Information IE\n    nor Serving Network IE from the MME in step\u00a015, no message is sent in\n    this step and downlink packets from the Serving-GW are immediately sent\n    on to the target eNodeB.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path in\n    order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. The\n    source Serving GW shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the source\n    eNodeB. If data forwarding -direct or indirect) occurs, the source\n    eNodeB shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target eNodeB via\n    the forwarding tunnel.\n\n  17.  The Serving GW shall return a Modify Bearer Response (Serving GW\n    address and TEID for uplink traffic) message to the MME as a response\n    to a Modify Bearer Request message, or a Modify Access Bearers Response\n    (Serving GW address and TEID for uplink traffic) as a response to a\n    Modify Access Bearers Request message. If the Serving GW cannot serve\n    the MME Request in the Modify Access Bearers Request message without\n    S5/S8 signalling other than to unpause charging in the PDN GW or\n    without corresponding Gxc signalling when PMIP is used over the S5/S8\n    interface, it shall respond to the MME with indicating that the\n    modifications are not limited to S1-U bearers, and the MME shall repeat\n    its request using Modify Bearer Request message per PDN connection.\n\n     If the Serving GW does not change, the Serving GW shall send one or\n    more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching\n    the path in order to assist the reordering function in the target\n    eNodeB. If data forwarding -direct or indirect) occurs, the source\n    eNodeB shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the target eNodeB via\n    the forwarding tunnel.18.  The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update\n    procedure when one of the conditions listed in clause \"Triggers for\n    tracking area update\" applies.\n\n     For a UE supporting CIoT EPS Optimisations, the EPS bearer status\n    information shall be included in the TAU Request. The MME shall then\n    indicate the EPS bearer status to the UE in the TAU Accept and the UE\n    shall locally release any non-transferred bearer.\n\n     The target MME knows that it is a Handover procedure that has been\n    performed for this UE as it received the bearer context(s) by handover\n    messages and therefore the target MME performs only a subset of the TA\n    update procedure, specifically it excludes the context transfer\n    procedures between source MME and target MME. In this case, the target\n    MME shall set the Header Compression Context Status for each EPS Bearer\n    in the TAU Accept message based on information obtained in step\u00a03.\n\n  19.  When the timer started in step 14 expires the source MME sends a UE\n    Context Release Command () message to the source eNodeB. The source\n    eNodeB releases its resources related to the UE and responds with a UE\n    Context Release Complete () message. When the timer started in step 14\n    expires and if the source MME received the Serving GW change indication\n    in the Forward Relocation Response message, it deletes the EPS bearer\n    resources by sending Delete Session Request (Cause, LBI, Operation\n    Indication, Secondary RAT usage data) messages to the Source Serving\n    GW. The operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to the\n    Source Serving GW that the Source Serving GW shall not initiate a\n    delete procedure towards the PDN GW. Secondary RAT usage data is\n    included if it was received in step\u00a09b. The Source Serving GW\n    acknowledges with Delete Session Response () messages. If ISR has been\n    activated before this procedure, the cause indicates to the Source S-GW\n    that the Source S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on the other old\n    CN node by sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN node.\n\n  20.  If indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at\n    source MME started at step\u00a014 triggers the source MME to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the S-GW to release\n    the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding that were\n    allocated at step\u00a08.\n\n  21.  If indirect forwarding was used and the Serving GW is relocated,\n    then the expiry of the timer at target MME started at step\u00a014 triggers\n    the target MME to send a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request\n    message to the target S-GW to release temporary resources used for\n    indirect forwarding that were allocated at step\u00a06.\n\n\n5.5.1.2.3   S1-based handover, Reject\n\nThe Target eNodeB rejects the use of the Handover procedure if none of the\nrequested bearers in the Handover Request message could be established. In\nthis case no UE context is established in the target MME/eNodeB and no\nresources are allocated. Further, the Target MME rejects the handover\nrequest and clears all resource in Target eNodeB and Target MME if the\nTarget eNodeB accepts the handover request but none of the default EPS\nbearers gets resources allocated. In both cases, the UE remains in the\nSource eNodeB/MME.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n                Figure 5.5.1.2.3-1: S1-based handover, Reject\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  Steps 3, 4, 7 and 8 are performed if the MME is relocated.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the MME is not relocated Steps 5 and 6 are performed by the\n         source MME and, in the description below, the source MME acts as\n         the target MME.\n\n  1-5. Steps 1 to 5 in the flow are identical to steps 1-5 in\n    clause\u00a05.5.1.2.2.\n\n  6a.  If the Target eNodeB fails to allocate any resources for any of the\n    requested EPS bearers it sends a Handover Failure (Cause) message to\n    the Target MME. The Target MME clears any reserved resources for this\n    UE in the target MME.\n\n  6b.  If the Target MME receives a Handover Request Acknowledge message\n    from the Target eNodeB but none of the default EPS bearers are in the\n    EPS Bearer Setup list IE, the Target MME clears any reserved resources\n    for this UE in both the Target MME and the Target eNodeB.\n\n  7. This step is only performed for Serving GW relocation, i.e. if\n    steps\u00a04/4a have been performed.

The source MME determines from the 'Target RNC Identifier' IE that the\n    type of handover is IRAT Handover to UTRAN Iu mode. The source MME\n    selects the target SGSN as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.4 on \"SGSN\n    Selection Function\". The Source MME initiates the Handover resource\n    allocation procedure by sending a Forward Relocation Request (IMSI,\n    Target Identification, CSG ID, CSG Membership Indication, MM Context,\n    PDN Connections, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, MME\n    Address for Control plane, Source to Target Transparent Container, RAN\n    Cause, MS Info Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information\n    Reporting Action (if available), UE Time Zone, ISR Supported, Serving\n    Network) message to the target SGSN.

When ISR is activated the message should be\n    sent to the SGSN that maintains ISR for the UE when this SGSN is\n    serving the target identified by the Target Identification. This\n    message includes all PDN Connections active in the source system and\n    for each PDN Connection includes the associated APN, the address and\n    the uplink Tunnel endpoint parameters of the Serving GW for control\n    plane, and a list of EPS Bearer Contexts. RAN Cause indicates the S1AP\n    Cause as received from source eNodeB. The old Serving Network is sent\n    to target MME to support the target MME to resolve if Serving Network\n    is changed.\n\n     The source MME shall perform access control by checking the UE's CSG\n    subscription when CSG ID is provided by the source eNodeB. If there is\n    no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription is\n    expired, and the target cell is a CSG cell, the source MME shall reject\n    the handover with an appropriate cause unless the UE has emergency\n    bearer services.\n\n     The source MME includes the CSG ID in the Forward Relocation Request\n    when the target cell is a CSG cell or hybrid cell. When the target cell\n    is a hybrid cell, or if there are one or several emergency bearers and\n    the target cell is a CSG cell, the CSG Membership Indication indicating\n    whether the UE is a CSG member shall be included in the Forward\n    Relocation Request message.\n\n     The MM context includes information on the EPS Bearer context(s). The\n    source MME does not include any EPS Bearer Context information for \"Non-\n    IP\" bearers or for any SCEF connection. If none of the UE's EPS Bearers\n    can be supported by the selected target SGSN, the source MME rejects\n    the handover attempt by sending a Handover Preparation Failure (Cause)\n    message to the Source eNodeB.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the handover is successful, the source MME will signal to the\n         SGW and/or SCEF to release any non-included EPS Bearers after\n         step\u00a06 of the Execution procedure. The non-included bearers are\n         locally released by the UE following the Bearer Context Status\n         synchronisation that occurs during the Routing Area Update at\n         step\u00a010 of the Execution procedure.\n\n     The target SGSN maps the EPS bearers to PDP contexts 1-to-1 and maps\n    the EPS Bearer QoS parameter values of an EPS bearer to the Release\u00a099\n    QoS parameter values of a bearer context as defined in Annex E\n\n     Prioritization of PDP Contexts is performed by the target core network\n    node, i.e. target SGSN.\n\n     The MM context contains security related information, e.g. supported\n    ciphering algorithms as described in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43]. Handling of\n    security keys is described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     The target SGSN shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on\n    the APN Restriction of each bearer context in the Forward Relocation\n    Request, and shall subsequently store the new Maximum APN restriction\n    value.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW the source MME shall include the Local\n    Home Network ID of the source cell in the PDN Connections corresponding\n    to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n  4. The target SGSN determines if the Serving GW is to be relocated, e.g.,\n    due to PLMN change. If the Serving GW is to be relocated, the target\n    SGSN selects the target Serving GW as described under clause 4.3.8.2 on\n    \"Serving GW selection function\", and sends a Create Session Request\n    message (IMSI, SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN\n    Address for Control plane, PDN GW address(es) for user plane, PDN GW UL\n    TEID(s) for user plane, PDN GW address(es) for control plane, and PDN\n    GW TEID(s) for control plane, the Protocol Type over S5/S8, Serving\n    Network) per PDN connection to the target Serving GW. The Protocol Type\n    over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which protocol should be used over\n    S5/S8 interface.\n\n     The target SGSN establishes the EPS Bearer context(s) in the indicated\n    order. The SGSN deactivates, as provided in step\u00a07 of the execution\n    phase, the EPS Bearer contexts which cannot be established.\n\n  4a.  The target Serving GW allocates its local resources and returns a\n    Create Session Response (Serving GW address(es) for user plane, Serving\n    GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, Serving GW Address for control plane,\n    Serving GW TEID for control plane) message to the target SGSN.\n\n  5. The target SGSN requests the target RNC to establish the radio network\n    resources (RABs) by sending the message Relocation Request (UE\n    Identifier, Cause, CN Domain Indicator, Integrity protection\n    information (i.e. IK and allowed Integrity Protection algorithms),\n    Encryption information (i.e. CK and allowed Ciphering algorithms), RAB\n    to be setup list, CSG ID, CSG Membership Indication, Source RNC to\n    Target RNC Transparent Container, Service Handover related\n    information). If the Access Restriction is present in the MM context,\n    the Service Handover related information shall be included by the\n    target SGSN for the Relocation Request message in order for RNC to\n    restrict the UE in connected mode to handover to the RAT prohibited by\n    the Access Restriction.\n\n     For each RAB requested to be established, RABs To Be Setup shall\n    contain information such as RAB ID, RAB parameters, Transport Layer\n    Address, and Iu Transport Association. The RAB ID information element\n    contains the NSAPI value, and the RAB parameters information element\n    gives the QoS profile. The Transport Layer Address is the Serving GW\n    Address for user plane (if Direct Tunnel is used) or the SGSN Address\n    for user plane (if Direct Tunnel is not used), and the Iu Transport\n    Association corresponds to the uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data\n    in Serving GW or SGSN respectively.\n\n     Ciphering and integrity protection keys are sent to the target RNC to\n    allow data transfer to continue in the new RAT/mode target cell without\n    requiring a new AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) procedure.\n    Information that is required to be sent to the UE (either in the\n    Relocation Command message or after the handover completion message)\n    from RRC in the target RNC shall be included in the RRC message sent\n    from the target RNC to the UE via the transparent container. More\n    details are described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     The Target SGSN shall include the CSG ID and CSG Membership Indication\n    when provided by the source MME in the Forward Relocation Request\n    message.\n\n     In the target RNC radio and Iu user plane resources are reserved for\n    the accepted RABs. Cause indicates the RAN Cause as received from\n    source MME. The Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container includes\n    the value from the Source to Target Transparent Container received from\n    the source eNodeB.\n\n     If the target cell is a CSG cell, the target RNC shall verify the CSG\n    ID provided by the target SGSN, and reject the handover with an\n    appropriate cause if it does not match the CSG ID for the target cell.\n    If the target cell is in hybrid mode, the target RNC may use the CSG\n    Membership Indication to perform differentiated treatment for CSG and\n    non-CSG members. If the target cell is a CSG cell, and if the CSG\n    Membership Indication is \"non member\", the target RNC only accepts the\n    emergency bearers.\n\n  5a.  The target RNC allocates the resources and returns the applicable\n    parameters to the target SGSN in the message Relocation Request\n    Acknowledge (Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container, RABs setup\n    list, RABs failed to setup list).\n\n     Upon sending the Relocation Request Acknowledge message the target RNC\n    shall be prepared to receive downlink GTP PDUs from the Serving GW, or\n    Target SGSN if Direct Tunnel is not used, for the accepted RABs.\n\n     Each RABs setup list is defined by a Transport Layer Address, which is\n    the target RNC Address for user data, and the Iu Transport Association,\n    which corresponds to the downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for user\n    data.\n\n     Any EPS Bearer contexts for which a RAB was not established are\n    maintained in the target SGSN and the UE. These EPS Bearer contexts\n    shall be deactivated by the target SGSN via explicit SM procedures upon\n    the completion of the routing area update (RAU) procedure.\n\n  6. If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW apply and Direct\n    Tunnel is used the target SGSN sends a Create Indirect Data Forwarding\n    Tunnel Request message (Target RNC Address and TEID(s) for DL data\n    forwarding) to the Serving GW. If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation\n    of Serving GW apply and Direct Tunnel is not used, then the target SGSN\n    sends a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message (SGSN\n    Address and TEID(s) for DL data forwarding) to the Serving GW.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  6a.  The Serving GW returns a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Response (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and Serving GW DL TEID(s) for\n    data forwarding) message to the target SGSN.\n\n  7. The target SGSN sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause,\n    SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN Address for\n    Control Plane, Target to Source Transparent Container, Cause, RAB Setup\n    Information, Additional RAB Setup Information, Address(es) and TEID(s)\n    for User Traffic Data Forwarding, Serving GW change indication) to the\n    source MME. Serving GW change indication indicates a new Serving GW has\n    been selected. The Target to Source Transparent Container contains the\n    value from the Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container received\n    from the target RNC.\n\n     The IE 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding'\n    defines the destination tunnelling endpoint for data forwarding in\n    target system, and it is set as follows:\n\n    -  If 'Direct Forwarding' applies, or if 'Indirect Forwarding' and no\n       relocation of Serving GW apply and Direct Tunnel is used, then the IE\n       'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding' contains\n       the addresses and GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to the Target RNC\n       received in step\u00a05a.\n\n    -  If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW apply, then\n       the IE 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding'\n       contains the addresses and DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to the\n       Serving GW received in step\u00a06. This is independent from using Direct\n       Tunnel or not.\n\n    -  If 'Indirect Forwarding' applies and Direct Tunnel is not used and\n       relocation of Serving GW does not apply, then the IE 'Address(es) and\n       TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding' contains the DL GTP-U\n       tunnel endpoint parameters to the Target SGSN.\n\n  8. If \"Indirect Forwarding\" applies, the Source MME sends the message\n    Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (Address(es) and TEID(s)\n    for Data Forwarding (received in step 7)), EPS Bearer ID(s)) to the\n    Serving GW used for indirect forwarding.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  8a.  The Serving GW returns the forwarding parameters by sending the\n    message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response (Cause, Serving\n    GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding). If the Serving GW\n    doesn't support data forwarding, an appropriate cause value shall be\n    returned and the Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) will not be\n    included in the message.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Execution phase", "numbering": "5.5.2.1.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.1.3   Execution phase\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n Figure 5.5.2.1.3-1: E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT HO, execution phase\n\n  NOTE:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].

The source MME completes the preparation phase towards source eNodeB\n    by sending the message Handover Command (Target to Source Transparent\n    Container, E-RABs to Release List, Bearers Subject to Data Forwarding\n    List). The \"Bearers Subject to Data forwarding list\" IE may be included\n    in the message and it shall be a list of 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for\n    user traffic data forwarding' received from target side in the\n    preparation phase (Step\u00a07 of the preparation phase) when 'Direct\n    Forwarding' applies, or the parameters received in Step\u00a08a of the\n    preparation phase when 'Indirect Forwarding' applies.\n\n     The source eNodeB initiates data forwarding for bearers specified in\n    the \"Bearers Subject to Data Forwarding List\". The data forwarding may\n    go directly to target RNC or alternatively go via the Serving GW if so\n    decided by source MME and or/ target SGSN in the preparation phase.\n\n  2. The source eNodeB will give a command to the UE to handover to the\n    target access network via the message HO from E-UTRAN Command. This\n    message includes a transparent container including radio aspect\n    parameters that the target RNC has set-up in the preparation phase. The\n    details of this E-UTRAN specific signalling are described in\n    TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5].\n\n     Upon the reception of the HO from E-UTRAN Command message containing\n    the Handover Command message, the UE shall associate its bearer IDs to\n    the respective RABs based on the relation with the NSAPI and shall\n    suspend the uplink transmission of the user plane data.\n\n  3. If the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and the\n    source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the eNodeB sends\n    the RAN Usage data report message (Secondary RAT usage data) to the\n    MME. Since the handover is an inter-RAT handover, the MME continues\n    with the Secondary RAT usage data reporting procedure as in\n    clause\u00a05.7A.3. The reporting procedure in clause\u00a05.7A.3 is only\n    performed if PGW secondary RAT usage reporting is active.\n\n  4. The UE moves to the target UTRAN Iu (3G) system and executes the\n    handover according to the parameters provided in the message delivered\n    in step 2. The procedure is the same as in step 6 and 8 in clause\n    5.2.2.2 in TS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8] with the additional function of association of\n    the received RABs and existing Bearer Id related to the particular\n    NSAPI.\n\n     The UE may resume the user data transfer only for those NSAPIs for\n    which there are radio resources allocated in the target RNC.\n\n  5. When the new source RNC-ID + S-RNTI are successfully exchanged with\n    the UE, the target RNC shall send the Relocation Complete message to\n    the target SGSN. The purpose of the Relocation Complete procedure is to\n    indicate by the target RNC the completion of the relocation from the\n    source E-UTRAN to the RNC. After the reception of the Relocation\n    Complete message the target SGSN shall be prepared to receive data from\n    the target RNC. Each uplink N-PDU received by the target SGSN is\n    forwarded directly to the Serving GW.\n\n     For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW architecture, the\n    target RNC shall include the Local Home Network ID of the target cell\n    in the Relocation Complete message.\n\n  6. Then the target SGSN knows that the UE has arrived to the target side\n    and target SGSN informs the source MME by sending the Forward\n    Relocation Complete Notification (ISR Activated, Serving GW change)\n    message. If indicated, ISR Activated indicates to the source MME that\n    it shall maintain the UE's context and that it shall activate ISR,\n    which is only possible when the S-GW is not changed. The source MME\n    will also acknowledge that information. A timer in source MME is\n    started to supervise when resources in Source eNodeB and Source Serving\n    GW (for Serving GW relocation) shall be released.\n\n     When the timer expires and ISR Activated is not indicated by the\n    target SGSN the source MME releases all bearer resources of the UE. If\n    Serving GW change is indicated and this timer expires the source MME\n    deletes the EPS bearer resources by sending Delete Session Request\n    (Cause, Operation Indication) messages to the Source Serving GW. The\n    operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to the Source\n    Serving GW that the Source Serving GW shall not initiate a delete\n    procedure towards the PDN GW. If ISR has been activated before this\n    procedure, the cause indicates to the Source S-GW that the Source S-GW\n    shall delete the bearer resources on the other old CN node by sending\n    Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN node.\n\n     Upon receipt of the Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge message\n    the target SGSN starts a timer if the target SGSN allocated S-GW\n    resources for indirect forwarding.\n\n     For all bearers that were not included in the Forward Relocation\n    Request message sent in step\u00a03, the MME now releases them by sending a\n    Delete Bearer Command to the SGW, or, the appropriate message to the\n    SCEF.\n\n  7. The target SGSN will now complete the Handover procedure by informing\n    the Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) that the target SGSN is now responsible for all the EPS\n    Bearer Contexts the UE has established. This is performed in the\n    message Modify Bearer Request (SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for\n    Control Plane, NSAPI(s), SGSN Address for Control Plane, SGSN\n    Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic for the accepted EPS bearers\n    (if Direct Tunnel is not used) or RNC Address(es) and TEID(s) for User\n    Traffic for the accepted EPS bearers (if Direct Tunnel is used) and RAT\n    type, ISR Activated) per PDN connection. As it is a mobility from E-\n    UTRAN, if the target SGSN supports location information change\n    reporting, the target SGSN shall include the User Location Information\n    (according to the supported granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request,\n    regardless of whether location information change reporting had been\n    requested in the previous RAT by the PDN GW. If the PDN GW requested\n    User CSG information (determined from the UE context), the SGSN also\n    includes the User CSG Information IE in this message. If the UE Time\n    Zone has changed, the SGSN includes the UE Time Zone IE in this\n    message. If Serving GW is not relocated but the Serving Network has\n    changed or if the SGSN has not received any old Serving Network\n    information from the old MME, the SGSN includes the new Serving Network\n    IE in this message. In network sharing scenarios Serving Network\n    denotes the serving core network. If indicated, the information ISR\n    Activated indicates that ISR is activated, which is only possible when\n    the S-GW is not changed. When the Modify Bearer Request does not\n    indicate ISR Activated and S-GW is not changed, the S-GW deletes any\n    ISR resources by sending a Delete Bearer Request to the other CN node\n    that has bearer resources on the S-GW reserved.\n\n     The SGSN releases the non-accepted EPS Bearer contexts by triggering\n    the Bearer Context deactivation procedure. If the Serving GW receives a\n    DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops the DL packet\n    and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the SGSN.\n\n  8. The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) may inform the PDN GW(s) the change of for example for\n    Serving GW relocation or the RAT type that e.g. can be used for\n    charging, by sending the message Modify Bearer Request per PDN\n    connection. The S-GW also includes User Location Information IE and/or\n    UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE if they are present in\n    step\u00a07. Serving Network should be included if it is received in step\u00a07\n    or in step\u00a04 in clause\u00a05.5.2.1.2. For Serving GW relocation, the\n    Serving GW allocates DL TEIDs on S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers\n    and may include the PDN Charging Pause Support Indication. The PDN GW\n    must acknowledge the request with the message Modify Bearer Response.\n    In the case of Serving GW relocation, the PDN GW updates its context\n    field and returns a Modify Bearer Response (Charging Id, MSISDN, PDN\n    Charging Pause Enabled Indication (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the\n    function), etc.) message to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is included if\n    the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. If location information\n    change reporting is required and supported in the target SGSN, the PDN\n    GW shall provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer\n    Response.\n\n     If PCC infrastructure is used, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the\n    change of, for example, the RAT type.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path.\n    The source Serving GW shall forwards the \"end marker\" packets to the\n    source eNodeB.\n\n  9. The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) acknowledges the user plane switch to the target SGSN via\n    the message Modify Bearer Response (Cause, Serving GW Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, Serving GW Address for Control Plane,\n    Protocol Configuration Options, MS Info Change Reporting Action). At\n    this stage the user plane path is established for all EPS Bearer\n    contexts between the UE, target RNC, target SGSN if Direct Tunnel is\n    not used, Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) and PDN GW.\n\n     If the Serving GW does not change, the Serving GW shall send one or\n    more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching\n    the path.\n\n  10.  When the UE recognises that its current Routing Area is not\n    registered with the network, or when the UE's TIN indicates \"GUTI\", the\n    UE initiates a Routing Area Update procedure with the target SGSN\n    informing it that the UE is located in a new routing area. It is RAN\n    functionality to provide the PMM-CONNECTED UE with Routing Area\n    information.\n\n     The target SGSN knows that an IRAT Handover has been performed for\n    this UE as it received the bearer context(s) by handover messages and\n    therefore the target SGSN performs only a subset of the RAU procedure,\n    specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures between source\n    MME and target SGSN.\n\n     For a UE supporting CIoT EPS Optimisations, the UE uses the bearer\n    status information in the RAU Accept to identify any non-transferred\n    bearers that it shall locally release.\n\n  11.  When the timer started at step\u00a06 expires, the source MME sends a\n    Release Resources message to the Source eNodeB. The Source eNodeB\n    releases its resources related to the UE.\n\n     When the timer started in step 6 expires and if the source MME\n    received the Serving GW change indication in the Forward Relocation\n    Response message, it deletes the EPS bearer resources by sending Delete\n    Session Request (Cause, Operation Indication, Secondary RAT usage data)\n    messages to the Source Serving GW. The operation indication flag is not\n    set, that indicates to the Source Serving GW that the Source Serving GW\n    shall not initiate a delete procedure towards the PDN GW. Secondary RAT\n    usage data is included if it was received in step\u00a03. The Source Serving\n    GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (Cause) messages. If ISR\n    has been activated before this procedure, the cause indicates to the\n    Source S-GW that the Source S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on\n    the other old CN node by sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to\n    that CN node.\n\n  12.  If indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at\n    source MME started at step\u00a06 triggers the source MME to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the S-GW to release\n    the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding.\n\n  13.  If indirect forwarding was used and the Serving GW is relocated,\n    then the expiry of the timer at target SGSN started at step\u00a06 triggers\n    the target SGSN to send a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Request message to the target S-GW to release temporary resources used\n    for indirect forwarding.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT handover Reject", "numbering": "5.5.2.1.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.1.4   E-UTRAN to UTRAN Iu mode Inter RAT handover Reject\n\nThe Target RNC may reject the use of the Handover procedure if none of the\nrequested RABs in the Relocation Request message could be established.

The source RNC decides to initiate an Inter-RAT handover to the E-\n    UTRAN. At this point both uplink and downlink user data is transmitted\n    via the following: Bearers between UE and source RNC, GTP tunnel(s)\n    between source RNC, source SGSN (only if Direct Tunnel is not used),\n    Serving GW and PDN GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The process leading to the handover decision is outside of the\n         scope of this specification.\n\n  2. The source RNC sends a Relocation Required (Cause, Target eNodeB\n    Identifier, CSG ID, CSG access mode, Source RNC Identifier, Source RNC\n    to Target RNC Transparent Container) message to the source SGSN to\n    request the CN to establish resources in the target eNodeB, Target MME\n    and the Serving GW.

When the target cell is a CSG cell or a hybrid cell, the source\n    RNC shall include the CSG ID of the target cell. If the target cell is\n    a hybrid cell, the CSG access mode shall be indicated.\n\n  3. The source SGSN determines from the 'Target eNodeB Identifier' IE that\n    the type of handover is IRAT Handover to E-UTRAN. The source SGSN\n    selects the target MME as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.3 on \"MME Selection\n    Function\". The Source SGSN initiates the Handover resource allocation\n    procedure by sending Forward Relocation Request (IMSI, Target\n    Identification, CSG ID, CSG Membership Indication, MM Context, PDN\n    Connections, SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN\n    Address for Control plane, Source to Target Transparent Container, RAN\n    Cause, MS Info Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG Information\n    Reporting Action (if available), UE Time Zone, ISR Supported, Serving\n    Network, Change to Report (if present)) message to the target MME. This\n    message includes all EPS Bearer contexts corresponding to all the\n    bearers established in the source system and the uplink Tunnel endpoint\n    parameters of the Serving GW. If the information ISR Supported is\n    indicated, this indicates that the source SGSN and associated Serving\n    GW are capable to activate ISR for the UE. When ISR is activated the\n    message should be sent to the MME that maintains ISR for the UE when\n    this MME is serving the target identified by the Target Identification.\n    RAN Cause indicates the Cause as received from source RNC. The Source\n    to Target Transparent Container contains the value from the Source RNC\n    to Target RNC Transparent Container received from the Source RNC. The\n    old Serving Network is sent to target MME to support the target MME to\n    resolve if Serving Network is changed.\n\n     Change to Report flag is included by the source SGSN if reporting of\n    change of UE Time Zone, or Serving Network, or both towards Serving GW\n    / PDN GW was deferred by the source SGSN.\n\n     The source SGSN shall perform access control by checking the UE's CSG\n    subscription when CSG ID is provided by the source RNC. If there is no\n    subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription is expired,\n    and the target cell is a CSG cell, the source SGSN shall reject the\n    handover with an appropriate cause unless the UE has emergency bearer\n    services.\n\n     The source SGSN includes the CSG ID in the Forward Relocation Request\n    when the target cell is a CSG cell or hybrid cell. When the target cell\n    is a hybrid cell, or if there are one or several emergency bearers and\n    the target cell is a CSG cell, the CSG Membership Indication indicating\n    whether the UE is a CSG member shall be included in the Forward\n    Relocation Request message.\n\n     This message includes all PDN Connections active in the source system\n    and for each PDN Connection includes the associated APN, the address\n    and the uplink tunnel endpoint parameters of the Serving GW for control\n    plane, and a list of EPS Bearer Contexts.\n\n     Prioritization of EPS Bearer Contexts is performed by the target core\n    network node.\n\n     The MM context contains security related information, e.g. UE Network\n    capabilities and used UMTS integrity and ciphering algorithm(s) as well\n    as keys, as described in clause\u00a05.7.2 (Information Storage for MME).\n\n     The target MME selects the NAS ciphering and integrity algorithms to\n    use. These algorithms will be sent transparently from the target eNodeB\n    to the UE in the Target to Source Transparent Container (EPC part).\n\n     The MME establishes the EPS bearer(s) in the prioritized order. The\n    MME deactivates, as provided in step\u00a08 of the execution phase, the EPS\n    bearers which cannot be established.\n\n     The target MME shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on\n    the APN Restriction of each bearer context received in the Forward\n    Relocation Request, and shall subsequently store the new Maximum APN\n    restriction value.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW the source SGSN shall include the\n    Local Home Network ID of the source cell in the PDN Connections\n    corresponding to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n  4. The target MME determines if the Serving GW is to be relocated, e.g.,\n    due to PLMN change. If the Serving GW is to be relocated, the target\n    MME selects the target Serving GW as described under clause 4.3.8.2 on\n    \"Serving GW selection function\". The target MME sends a Create Session\n    Request message (IMSI, MME Address and TEID, MME Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, MME Address for Control plane, PDN GW\n    address(es) for user plane, PDN GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, PDN GW\n    address for control plane, and PDN GW TEID(s) for control plane, the\n    Protocol Type over S5/S8, Serving Network) per PDN connection to the\n    target Serving GW. The Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to Serving\n    GW which protocol should be used over S5/S8 interface.\n\n  4a.  The target Serving GW allocates its local resources and returns them\n    in a Create Session Response (Serving GW address(es) for user plane,\n    Serving GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, Serving GW Address for control\n    plane, Serving GW TEID for control plane) message to the target MME.\n\n  5. The target MME requests the target eNodeB to establish the bearer(s)\n    by sending the message Handover Request (UE Identifier, S1AP Cause,\n    KeNB, allowed AS Integrity Protection and Ciphering algorithm(s), NAS\n    Security Parameters to E-UTRAN, EPS Bearers to be setup list, CSG ID,\n    CSG Membership Indication, Source to Target Transparent Container). The\n    NAS Security Parameters to E-UTRAN includes the NAS Integrity\n    Protection and Ciphering algorithm(s), eKSI and NONCEMME are targeted\n    for the UE. S1AP Cause indicates the RAN Cause as received from source\n    SGSN. The Source to Target Transparent Container contains the value\n    from the RAN Transparent Container received from the source SGSN.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The target MME derives K'ASME from CK and IK in the MM context\n         and associates it with eKSI, as described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41] and\n         selects NAS Integrity Protection and Ciphering algorithm(s). The\n         MME and UE derive the NAS keys and KeNB from K'ASME. If the MME\n         shares an EPS security association with the UE, the MME may\n         activate this native EPS security context by initiating a NAS SMC\n         procedure after having completed the handover procedure.\n\n     For each EPS bearer requested to be established, 'EPS Bearers To Be\n    Setup' IE shall contain information such as ID, bearer parameters,\n    Transport Layer Address, \"Data forwarding not possible\" indication, and\n    S1 Transport Association. The target MME ignores any Activity Status\n    Indicator within an EPS Bearer Context and requests the target eNodeB\n    to allocate resources for all EPS Bearer Contexts received from the\n    source side. The Transport Layer Address is the Serving GW Address for\n    user data, and the S1 Transport Association corresponds to the uplink\n    Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data. \"Data forwarding not possible\"\n    indication shall be included if the target MME decides the\n    corresponding bearer will not be subject to data forwarding.\n\n     The target MME shall include the CSG ID and CSG Membership Indication\n    when provided by the source SGSN in the Handover Request message.\n\n     The information about the selected NAS ciphering and integrity\n    protection algorithm(s), KSI and NONCEMME will be sent transparently\n    from the target eNodeB to the UE in the Target to Source Transparent\n    Container, and in the message UTRAN HO Command from source RNC to the\n    UE. This will then allow data transfer to continue in the new RAT/mode\n    target cell without requiring a new AKA (Authentication and Key\n    Agreement) procedure. More details are described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     If the target cell is a CSG cell, the target eNodeB shall verify the\n    CSG ID provided by the target MME, and reject the handover with an\n    appropriate cause if it does not match the CSG ID for the target cell.\n    If the target eNodeB is in hybrid mode, it may use the CSG Membership\n    Status to perform differentiated treatment for CSG and non-CSG members.\n    If the target cell is a CSG cell, and if the CSG Membership Indication\n    is \"non member\", the target eNodeB only accepts the emergency bearers.\n\n  5a.  The target eNodeB allocates the requested resources and returns the\n    applicable parameters to the target MME in the message Handover Request\n    Acknowledge (Target to Source Transparent Container, EPS Bearers setup\n    list, EPS Bearers failed to setup list). The target eNodeB shall ignore\n    it if the number of radio bearers in the Source to Target Transparent\n    container does not comply with the number of bearers requested by the\n    MME and allocate bearers as requested by the MME. Upon sending the\n    Handover Request Acknowledge message the target eNodeB shall be\n    prepared to receive downlink GTP PDUs from the Serving GW for the\n    accepted EPS bearers.\n\n     The target eNodeB selects AS integrity and ciphering algorithm(s). In\n    addition to the information provided by the MME (eKSI, NAS Integrity\n    Protection and Ciphering algorithm(s) and NONCEMME), the target eNodeB\n    inserts AS integrity and ciphering algorithm(s) into the UTRAN RRC\n    message, which is contained in the Target to Source Transparent\n    Container.\n\n  6. If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW apply the target\n    MME sends a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message\n    (Target eNodeB Address, TEID(s) for DL data forwarding) to the Serving\n    GW.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  6a.  The Serving GW returns a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Response (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and Serving GW DL TEID(s) for\n    data forwarding) message to the target MME.\n\n  7. The target MME sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause,\n    List of Set Up RABs, EPS Bearers setup list, MME Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, RAN Cause, MME Address for control plane,\n    Target to Source Transparent Container, Address(es) and TEID(s) for\n    Data Forwarding, Serving GW change indication) to the source SGSN.\n    Serving GW change indication indicates whether a new Serving GW has\n    been selected. The Target to Source Transparent Container includes the\n    value from the Target to Source Transparent Container received from the\n    target eNodeB.\n\n     The IE 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding'\n    defines the destination tunnelling endpoint for data forwarding in\n    target system, and it is set as follows. If 'Direct Forwarding' or if\n    'Indirect Forwarding' but no relocation of Serving GW applies, then the\n    IEs 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding' contains the\n    forwarding DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to the eNodeB received\n    in step\u00a05a.\n\n     If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW apply the IEs\n    'Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding' contains the DL GTP-U\n    tunnel endpoint parameters to the Target eNodeB or to the forwarding\n    Serving GW received in step\u00a06a.\n\n  8. If \"Indirect Forwarding\" applies, the source SGSN shall send the\n    message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (Address(es) and\n    TEID(s) for Data Forwarding (received in step\u00a07)) to the Serving GW\n    used for indirect forwarding.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  8a.  The Serving GW returns the forwarding user plane parameters by\n    sending the message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response\n    (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for data forwarding). If the\n    Serving GW doesn't support data forwarding, an appropriate cause value\n    shall be returned and the Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) will not\n    be included in the message.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Execution phase", "numbering": "5.5.2.2.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.2.3   Execution phase\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n Figure 5.5.2.2.3-1: UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution phase\n\n  NOTE:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].

If 'Indirect\n    Forwarding' is applicable and Direct Tunnel is used the \"RABs Subject\n    to Data Forwarding List\" IE includes the parameters received in Step\u00a08a\n    of the preparation phase. If 'Indirect Forwarding' is applicable and\n    Direct Tunnel is not used the \"RABs Subject to Data Forwarding List\" IE\n    includes the source SGSN address(es) and TEID(s) allocated for indirect\n    data forwarding by Source SGSN. The Target RNC to Source RNC\n    Transparent Container contains the value from the Target to Source\n    Transparent Container received from the target MME.\n\n  2. The source RNC will command to the UE to handover to the target eNodeB\n    via the message HO from UTRAN Command.

When the UE has successfully accessed the target eNodeB, the target\n    eNodeB informs the target MME by sending the message Handover Notify\n    (TAI+ECGI, Local Home Network ID).\n\n     For SIPTO at the Local Network with stand-alone GW architecture, the\n    target eNodeB shall include the Local Home Network ID of the target\n    cell in the Handover Notify message.\n\n  7. Then the target MME knows that the UE has arrived to the target side\n    and target MME informs the source SGSN by sending the Forward\n    Relocation Complete Notification (ISR Activated, Serving GW change)\n    message. If ISR Activated is indicated, this indicates to the source\n    SGSN that it shall maintain the UE's contexts and activate ISR, which\n    is only possible when the S-GW is not changed. The source SGSN shall\n    also acknowledge that information. A timer in source SGSN is started to\n    supervise when resources in the in Source RNC and Source Serving GW\n    (for Serving GW relocation) shall be released\n\n     Upon receipt of the Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge message\n    the target MME starts a timer if the target MME applies indirect\n    forwarding.\n\n  8. The target MME will now complete the Inter-RAT Handover procedure by\n    informing the Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the\n    Target Serving GW) that the target MME is now responsible for all the\n    bearers the UE have established. This is performed in the message\n    Modify Bearer Request (Cause, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for\n    Control Plane, EPS Bearer ID, MME Address for Control Plane, eNodeB\n    Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic for the accepted EPS bearers\n    and RAT type, ISR Activated) per PDN connection. As it is a mobility\n    from UTRAN, if the target MME supports location information change\n    reporting, the target MME shall include the User Location Information\n    (according to the supported granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request,\n    regardless of whether location information change reporting had been\n    requested in the previous RAT by the PDN GW. If the PDN GW requested\n    User CSG information (determined from the UE context), the MME also\n    includes the User CSG Information IE in this message. If either the UE\n    Time Zone has changed or Forward Relocation Request message from source\n    SGSN indicated pending UE Time Zone change reporting (via Change to\n    Report flag), the MME includes the UE Time Zone IE in this message. If\n    either Serving GW is not relocated but the Serving Network has changed\n    or Forward Relocation Request message from source SGSN indicated\n    pending Serving Network change reporting (via Change to Report flag),\n    the MME includes the new Serving Network IE in this message. If\n    indicated, the information ISR Activated indicates that ISR is\n    activated, which is only possible when the S-GW was not changed. When\n    the Modify Bearer Request does not indicate ISR Activated and S-GW is\n    not changed, the S-GW deletes any ISR resources by sending a Delete\n    Bearer Request to the other CN node that has bearer resources on the S-\n    GW reserved.\n\n     The MME releases the non-accepted dedicated bearers by triggering the\n    bearer release procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2. If the Serving\n    GW receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops\n    the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the\n    MME.\n\n     If the default bearer of a PDN connection has not been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB and there are other PDN connections active, the MME shall\n    handle it in the same way as if all bearers of a PDN connection have\n    not been accepted. The MME releases these PDN connections by triggering\n    the MME requested PDN disconnection procedure specified in\n    clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n  9. The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) may inform the PDN GW the change of for example for Serving\n    GW relocation or the RAT type that e.g. can be used for charging, by\n    sending the message Modify Bearer Request per PDN connection. The S-GW\n    also includes User Location Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE\n    and/or User CSG Information IE if they are present in step\u00a08. Serving\n    Network should be included if it is received in step\u00a08 or in step\u00a04 in\n    clause\u00a05.5.2.2.2. For Serving GW relocation, the Serving GW allocates\n    DL TEIDs on S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers and may include the PDN\n    Charging Pause Support Indication. The PDN GW must acknowledge the\n    request with the message Modify Bearer Response. In the case of Serving\n    GW relocation, the PDN GW updates its context field and returns a\n    Modify Bearer Response (Charging Id, MSISDN, PDN Charging Pause Enabled\n    Indication (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the function), etc.) message\n    to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is included if the PDN GW has it stored\n    in its UE context. If location information change reporting is required\n    and supported in the target MME, the PDN GW shall provide MS Info\n    Change Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer Response.\n\n     If PCC infrastructure is used, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the\n    change of, for example, the RAT type.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path in\n    order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. The\n    source Serving GW shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the source\n    SGSN or RNC.\n\n  10.  The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) acknowledges the user plane switch to the target MME via\n    the message Modify Bearer Response (Cause, Serving GW Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, Serving GW Address for Control Plane,\n    Protocol Configuration Options, MS Info Change Reporting Action). At\n    this stage the user plane path is established for all bearers between\n    the UE, target eNodeB, Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will\n    be the Target Serving GW) and PDN GW.\n\n     If the Serving GW does not change, the Serving GW shall send one or\n    more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching\n    the path in order to assist the reordering function in the target\n    eNodeB.\n\n  11.  The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure when one of the\n    conditions listed in clause \"Triggers for tracking area update\"\n    applies.\n\n     The target MME knows that an IRAT Handover has been performed for this\n    UE as it received the bearer context(s) by handover messages and\n    therefore the target MME performs only a subset of the TA update\n    procedure, specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures\n    between source SGSN and target MME.\n\n     If the Subscription Data received from the HSS (during the TAU in\n    step\u00a011) contains information that is necessary for the E-UTRAN to be\n    aware of (e.g. a restriction in the UE's permission to use NR as a\n    secondary RAT,  Unlicensed Spectrum or a combination of them), or an\n    existing UE context in the MME indicates that the UE is not permitted\n    to use NR as a secondary RAT or Unlicensed Spectrum or a combination of\n    them and the MME has not provided this information to the target eNodeB\n    during step\u00a05 of the handover preparation phase, then the MME sends an\n    updated Handover Restriction List in the Downlink NAS Transport message\n    that it sends to RAN. If the UE is not allowed to use NR as Secondary\n    RAT, the MME indicates that to the UE in TAU Accept message.\n\n  12.  When the timer started in step 7 expires the source SGSN will clean-\n    up all its resources towards source RNC by sending the Iu Release\n    Command to the RNC. When there is no longer any need for the RNC to\n    forward data, the source RNC responds with an Iu Release Complete\n    message.\n\n     When the timer started in step 7 expires and if the source SGSN\n    received the Serving GW change indication in the Forward Relocation\n    Response message, it deletes the EPS bearer resources by sending Delete\n    Session Request (Cause, Operation Indication) messages to the Source\n    Serving GW. The operation Indication flag is not set, that indicates to\n    the Source Serving GW that the Source Serving GW shall not initiate a\n    delete procedure towards the PDN GW. The Source Serving GW acknowledges\n    with Delete Session Response (Cause) messages. If ISR has been\n    activated before this procedure, the cause indicates to the Source S-GW\n    that the Source S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on the other old\n    CN node by sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN node.\n\n  13.  If indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at\n    source SGSN started at step\u00a07 triggers the source SGSN to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the S-GW to release\n    the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding.\n\n  14.  If indirect forwarding was used and the Serving GW is relocated,\n    then the expiry of the timer at target MME started at step\u00a07 triggers\n    the target MME to send a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request\n    message to the target S-GW to release temporary resources used for\n    indirect forwarding.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT handover reject", "numbering": "5.5.2.2.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.2.4   UTRAN Iu mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT handover reject\n\nThe Target eNodeB may reject the use of the Handover procedure if none of\nthe requested EPS bearers in the Handover Request message could be\nestablished.

The source eNodeB decides to initiate an Inter RAT Handover to the\n    target GERAN A/Gb mode (2G) system. At this point both uplink and\n    downlink user data is transmitted via the following: Bearer(s) between\n    UE and Source eNodeB, GTP tunnel(s) between Source eNodeB, Serving GW\n    and PDN GW.\n\n     If the UE has an ongoing emergency bearer service the source eNodeB\n    shall not initiate PS handover to GERAN.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The process leading to the handover decision is outside of the\n         scope of this specification\n\n  2. The source eNodeB sends a Handover Required (S1AP Cause, Target System\n    Identifier, Source to Target Transparent Container) message to the\n    Source MME to request the CN to establish resources in the Target BSS,\n    Target SGSN and the Serving GW. The bearers that will be subject to\n    data forwarding (if any) are identified by the target SGSN in a later\n    step (see step\u00a07 below).\n\n     The 'Target System Identifier' IE contains the identity of the target\n    global cell Id.\n\n  3. The Source MME determines from the 'Target System Identifier' IE that\n    the type of handover is IRAT Handover to GERAN A/Gb mode. The Source\n    MME selects the Target SGSN as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.4 on \"SGSN\n    Selection Function\". The Source MME initiates the Handover resource\n    allocation procedure by sending a Forward Relocation Request (IMSI,\n    Target Identification (shall be set to \"empty\"), MM Context, PDN\n    Connections, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, MME\n    Address for Control plane, Source to Target Transparent Container,\n    Packet Flow ID, XID parameters (if available), Target Cell\n    Identification, MS Info Change Reporting Action (if available), CSG\n    Information Reporting Action (if available), UE Time Zone, ISR\n    Supported, RAN Cause, Serving Network) message to the target SGSN. If\n    the information ISR Supported is indicated, this indicates that the\n    source MME and associated Serving GW are capable to activate ISR for\n    the UE. When ISR is activated the message should be sent to the SGSN\n    that maintains ISR for the UE when this SGSN is serving the target\n    identified by the Target Identification. This message includes all PDN\n    Connections active in the source system and for each PDN Connection\n    includes the associated APN, the address and the uplink Tunnel endpoint\n    parameters of the Serving GW for control plane, and a list of EPS\n    Bearer Contexts. The old Serving Network is sent to target MME to\n    support the target MME to resolve if Serving Network is changed. In\n    network sharing scenarios Serving Network denotes the serving core\n    network.\n\n     The MM context includes information on the EPS Bearer context(s). If\n    none of the UE's EPS Bearers can be supported by the selected target\n    SGSN, the source MME rejects the handover attempt by sending a Handover\n    Preparation Failure (Cause) message to the Source eNodeB.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  If the handover is successful, the source MME will signal to the\n         SGW and/or SCEF to release any non-included EPS Bearers after\n         step\u00a08 of the Execution procedure. The non-included bearers are\n         locally released by the UE following the Bearer Context Status\n         synchronisation that occurs during the Routing Area Update at\n         step\u00a013 of the Execution procedure.\n\n     The target SGSN maps the EPS bearers to PDP contexts 1-to-1 and maps\n    the EPS Bearer QoS parameter values of an EPS bearer to the Release\u00a099\n    QoS parameter values of a bearer context as defined in Annex E.\n\n     Prioritization of PDP Contexts is performed by the target core network\n    node, i.e. target SGSN.\n\n     If the Source MME supports IRAT Handover to GERAN A/Gb procedure it\n    has to allocate a valid PFI during the bearer activation procedure. RAN\n    Cause indicates the S1AP Cause as received from the source eNodeB. The\n    Source to Target Transparent Container includes the value from the\n    Source to Target Transparent Container received from the source eNodeB.\n\n     The MM context contains security related information, e.g. supported\n    ciphering algorithms, as described in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43]. Handling of\n    security keys is described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     The target SGSN selects the ciphering algorithm to use. This algorithm\n    will be sent transparently from the target SGSN to the UE in the NAS\n    container for Handover (part of the Target to Source Transparent\n    Container). The IOV-UI parameter, generated in the target SGSN, is used\n    as input to the ciphering procedure and it will also be transferred\n    transparently from the target SGSN to the UE in the NAS container for\n    Handover. More details are described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     When the target SGSN receives the Forward Relocation Request message\n    the required EPS Bearer, MM, SNDCP and LLC contexts are established and\n    a new P-TMSI is allocated for the UE. When this message is received by\n    the target SGSN, it begins the process of establishing PFCs for all EPS\n    Bearer contexts.\n\n     When the target SGSN receives the Forward Relocation Request message\n    it extracts from the EPS Bearer Contexts the NSAPIs and SAPIs and PFIs\n    to be used in the target SGSN. If for a given EPS Bearer Context the\n    target SGSN does not receive a PFI from the source MME, it shall not\n    request the target BSS to allocate TBF resources corresponding to that\n    EPS Bearer Context. If none of the EPS Bearer Contexts forwarded from\n    the source MME has a valid PFI allocated the target SGSN shall consider\n    this as a failure case and the request for Handover shall be rejected.\n\n     If when an SAPI and PFI was available at the source MME but the target\n    SGSN does not support the same SAPI and PFI for a certain NSAPI as the\n    source MME, the target SGSN shall continue the Handover procedure only\n    for those NSAPIs for which it can support the same PFI and SAPI as the\n    source MME. All EPS Bearer contexts for which no resources are\n    allocated by the target SGSN or for which it cannot support the same\n    SAPI and PFI (i.e. the corresponding NSAPIs are not addressed in the\n    response message of the target SGSN), are maintained and the related\n    SAPIs and PFIs are kept. These EPS Bearer contexts may be modified or\n    deactivated by the target SGSN via explicit SM procedures upon RAU\n    procedure.\n\n     The source MME shall indicate the current XID parameter settings if\n    available (i.e. those XID parameters received during a previous IRAT\n    Handover procedure) to the target SGSN. If the target SGSN can accept\n    all XID parameters as indicated by the source MME, the target SGSN\n    shall create a NAS container for Handover indicating 'Reset to the old\n    XID parameters'. Otherwise, if the target SGSN cannot accept all XID\n    parameters indicated by the source MME or if no XID parameters were\n    indicated by the source MME, the target SGSN shall create a NAS\n    container for Handover indicating Reset (i.e. reset to default\n    parameters).\n\n     The target SGSN shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on\n    the APN Restriction of each bearer context received in the Forward\n    Relocation Request, and shall subsequently store the new Maximum APN\n    restriction value.\n\n     If SIPTO at the Local Network is active for a PDN connection in the\n    architecture with stand-alone GW the source MME shall include the Local\n    Home Network ID of the source cell in the PDN Connections corresponding\n    to the SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connection.\n\n  4. The target SGSN determines if the Serving GW is to be relocated, e.g.,\n    due to PLMN change. If the Serving GW is to be relocated, the target\n    SGSN selects the target Serving GW as described under clause 4.3.8.2 on\n    \"Serving GW selection function\", and sends a Create Session Request\n    message (IMSI, SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN\n    Address for Control plane, PDN GW address(es) for user plane, PDN GW UL\n    TEID(s) for user plane, PDN GW address(es) for control plane, and PDN\n    GW TEID(s) for control plane, the Protocol Type over S5/S8, Serving\n    Network) per PDN connection to the target Serving GW. The Protocol Type\n    over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which protocol should be used over\n    S5/S8 interface.\n\n  4a.  The target Serving GW allocates its local resources and returns a\n    Create Session Response (Serving GW address(es) for user plane, Serving\n    GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, Serving GW Address for control plane,\n    Serving GW TEID for control plane) message to the target SGSN.\n\n  5. The target SGSN establishes the EPS Bearer context(s) in the indicated\n    order. The SGSN deactivates, as provided in step\u00a09 of the execution\n    phase, the EPS Bearer contexts which cannot be established.\n\n     The Target SGSN requests the Target BSS to establish the necessary\n    resources (PFCs) by sending the message PS Handover Request (Local\n    TLLI, IMSI, Cause, Target Cell Identifier, PFCs to be set-up list,\n    Source RNC to Target BSS Transparent Container and NAS container for\n    handover). The target SGSN shall not request resources for which the\n    Activity Status Indicator within a EPS Bearer Context indicates that no\n    active bearer exists on the source side for that PDP context. The Cause\n    indicates the RAN Cause as received from the source MME. The Source RNC\n    to Target BSS Transparent Container contains the value from the Source\n    to Target Transparent Container received from the source MME. All EPS\n    Bearer Contexts indicate active status because E-UTRAN does not support\n    selective RAB handling.\n\n     Based upon the ABQP for each PFC the target BSS makes a decision about\n    which PFCs to assign radio resources. The algorithm by which the BSS\n    decides which PFCs that need resources is implementation specific. Due\n    to resource limitations not all downloaded PFCs will necessarily\n    receive resource allocation. The target BSS allocates TBFs for each PFC\n    that it can accommodate.\n\n     The target BSS shall prepare the 'Target to Source Transparent\n    Container' which contains a PS Handover Command including the EPC part\n    (NAS container for Handover) and the RN part (Handover Radio\n    Resources).\n\n  5a.  The Target BSS allocates the requested resources and returns the\n    applicable parameters to the Target SGSN in the message PS Handover\n    Request Acknowledge (Local TLLI, List of set-up PFCs, Target BSS to\n    Source RNC Transparent Container, Cause). Upon sending the PS Handover\n    Request Acknowledge message the target BSS shall be prepared to receive\n    downlink LLC PDUs from the target SGSN for the accepted PFCs.\n\n     Any EPS Bearer contexts for which a PFC was not established are\n    maintained in the target SGSN and the related SAPIs and PFIs are kept.\n    These EPS Bearer contexts shall be deactivated by the target SGSN via\n    explicit SM procedures upon the completion of the routing area update\n    (RAU) procedure.\n\n  6. If indirect forwarding and relocation of Serving GW applies the target\n    SGSN sends a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message\n    (Target SGSN Address(es) and TEID(s) for DL data forwarding) to the\n    Serving GW used for indirect packet forwarding.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  6a.  The Serving GW returns a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Response (Cause, Serving GW DL Address(es) and TEID(s) for data\n    forwarding) message to the target SGSN.\n\n  7. The Target SGSN sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause,\n    SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN Address for\n    Control Plane, Target to Source Transparent Container, RAN Cause, List\n    of set-up PFIs, Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data\n    Forwarding, Serving GW change indication) to the Source MME. Serving GW\n    change indication indicates a new Serving GW has been selected. RAN\n    Cause indicates the Cause as received from the target BSS. The Target\n    to Source Transparent Container includes the value from the Target BSS\n    to Source RNC Transparent Container received from the target BSS.\n\n     If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW applies, then\n    the IEs 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data Forwarding'\n    contain the DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters received in step\u00a06a.\n    Otherwise the IEs 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic Data\n    Forwarding' contains the DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to the\n    Target SGSN.\n\n     The target SGSN activates the allocated LLC/SNDCP engines as specified\n    in TS\u00a044.064\u00a0[23] for an SGSN originated Reset or 'Reset to the old XID\n    parameters'.\n\n  8. If \"Indirect Forwarding\" applies, the Source MME sends the message\n    Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (Address(es) and TEID(s)\n    for Data Forwarding (received in step\u00a07)) to the Serving GW used for\n    indirect packet forwarding.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  8a.  The Serving GW returns the forwarding user plane parameters by\n    sending the message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response\n    (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding). If the\n    Serving GW doesn't support data forwarding, an appropriate cause value\n    shall be returned and the Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) will not\n    be included in the message.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Execution phase", "numbering": "5.5.2.3.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.3.3   Execution phase\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n   Figure 5.5.2.3.3-1: E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT HO, execution\n                                    phase\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) and (B) are defined\n         in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].

The Source MME completes the preparation phase towards Source eNodeB\n    by sending the message Handover Command (Target to Source Transparent\n    Container (PS Handover Command with RN part and EPC part), E-RABs to\n    Release List, Bearers Subject to Data Forwarding List), S1AP Cause. The\n    \"Bearers Subject to Data forwarding list\" may be included in the\n    message and it shall be a list of 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for user\n    traffic data forwarding' received from target side in the preparation\n    phase (Step\u00a07 of the preparation phase for Direct Forwarding, else\n    parameters received in Step\u00a08a of the preparation phase). S1AP Cause\n    indicates the RAN Cause as received from the target SGSN.\n\n     Source eNodeB initiate data forwarding for the bearers specified in\n    the \"Bearers Subject to Data Forwarding List\". The data forwarding may\n    go directly i.e. to target SGSN or alternatively go via the Serving GW\n    if so decided by source MME and/or target SGSN in the preparation\n    phase.\n\n  2. The Source eNodeB will give a command to the UE to handover to the\n    Target Access System via the message HO from E-UTRAN Command. This\n    message includes a transparent container including radio aspect\n    parameters that the Target BSS has set-up in the preparation phase (RN\n    part). This message also includes the XID and IOV-UI parameters\n    received from the Target SGSN (EPC part).\n\n     Upon the reception of the HO from E-UTRAN Command message containing\n    the Handover Command message, the UE shall associate its bearer IDs to\n    the respective PFIs based on the relation with the NSAPI and shall\n    suspend the uplink transmission of the user plane data.\n\n  3. If the PLMN has configured Secondary RAT usage data reporting and the\n    source eNodeB has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the eNodeB sends\n    the RAN Usage data report message (Secondary RAT usage data) to the\n    MME. Since the handover is an inter-RAT handover, the MME continues\n    with the Secondary RAT usage data reporting procedure as in\n    clause\u00a05.7A.3. The reporting procedure in clause\u00a05.7A.3 is only\n    performed if PGW secondary RAT usage reporting is active.\n\n  4. The UE moves to the Target GERAN A/Gb (2G) system and performs\n    executes the handover according to the parameters provided in the\n    message delivered in step 2. The procedure is the same as in step 6 in\n    clause 5.3.2.2 in TS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8] with the additional function of\n    association of the received PFI and existing Bearer Id related to the\n    particular NSAPI.\n\n  5. After accessing the cell using access bursts and receiving timing\n    advance information from the BSS in step 4, the UE processes the NAS\n    container and then sends one XID response message to the target SGSN\n    via target BSS. The UE sends this message immediately after receiving\n    the Packet Physical Information message containing the timing advance\n    or, in the synchronised network case, immediately if the PS Handover\n    Access message is not required to be sent.\n\n     Upon sending the XID Response message, the UE shall resume the user\n    data transfer only for those NSAPIs for which there are radio resources\n    allocated in the target cell. For NSAPIs using LLC ADM, for which radio\n    resources were not allocated in the target cell, the UE may request for\n    radio resources using the legacy procedures.\n\n     If the Target SGSN indicated XID Reset (i.e. reset to default XID\n    parameters) in the NAS container included in the HO from E-UTRAN\n    Command message, and to avoid collision cases the mobile station may\n    avoid triggering XID negotiation for any LLC SAPI used in LLC ADM, but\n    wait for the SGSN to do so (see step 12). In any case the mobile\n    station may avoid triggering XID negotiation for any LLC SAPI used in\n    LLC ABM, but wait for the SGSN to do so (see step 12a).\n\n     This step is the same as specified in clause 5.3.2.2 in TS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8].\n\n  6. Upon reception of the first correct RLC/MAC block (sent in normal\n    burst format) from the UE to the Target BSS, the Target BSS informs the\n    Target SGSN by sending the message PS Handover Complete (IMSI, and\n    Local TLLI, Request for Inter RAT Handover Info). The target BSS that\n    supports inter-RAT PS handover to UTRAN shall, when the INTER RAT\n    HANDOVER INFO was not included in the Source BSS to Target BSS\n    transparent container received in the PS HANDOVER REQUEST message as\n    specified in TS\u00a048.018\u00a0[42], request the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO from\n    the target SGSN by setting the 'Request for Inter RAT Handover Info' to\n    '1'.\n\n  7. The Target BSS also relays the message XID Response to the Target\n    SGSN. Note, the message in step 6 and 7 may arrive in any order in the\n    Target SGSN.\n\n  8. Then the Target SGSN knows that the UE has arrived to the target side\n    and Target SGSN informs the Source MME by sending the Forward\n    Relocation Complete Notification (ISR Activated, Serving GW change)\n    message. If ISR Activated is indicated, the source MME shall maintain\n    the UE's contexts and activate ISR, which is only possible when the S-\n    GW is not changed. The Source MME will also acknowledge that\n    information. A timer in source MME is started to supervise when\n    resources in Source eNodeB and Source Serving GW (for Serving GW\n    relocation) shall be released.\n\n     Upon receipt of the Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge message\n    the target SGSN starts a timer if the target SGSN allocated S-GW\n    resources for indirect forwarding.\n\n     For all bearers that were not included in the Forward Relocation\n    Request message sent in step\u00a03, the MME now releases them by sending a\n    Delete Bearer Command to the SGW, or, the appropriate message to the\n    SCEF.\n\n  9. The Target SGSN will now complete the Handover procedure by informing\n    the Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) that the Target SGSN is now responsible for all the EPS\n    Bearer Context(s) the UE has established. This is performed in the\n    message Modify Bearer Request (SGSN Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for\n    Control Plane, NSAPI(s), SGSN Address for Control Plane, SGSN\n    Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic for the accepted EPS bearers\n    and RAT type, ISR Activated) per PDN connection. As it is a mobility\n    from E-UTRAN, if the target SGSN supports location information change\n    reporting, the target SGSN shall include the User Location Information\n    (according to the supported granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request,\n    regardless of whether location information change reporting had been\n    requested in the previous RAT by the PDN GW. If the PDN GW requested\n    User CSG information (determined from the UE context), the SGSN also\n    includes the User CSG Information IE in this message. If the UE Time\n    Zone has changed, the SGSN includes the UE Time Zone IE in this\n    message. If Serving GW is not relocated but the Serving Network has\n    changed or if the SGSN has not received any old Serving Network\n    information from the old MME, the SGSN includes the new Serving Network\n    IE in this message. In network sharing scenarios Serving Network\n    denotes the serving core network. If indicated, ISR Activated indicates\n    that ISR is activated, which is only possible when the S-GW was not\n    changed. When the Modify Bearer Request does not indicate ISR Activated\n    and S-GW is not changed, the S-GW deletes any ISR resources by sending\n    a Delete Bearer Request to the other CN node that has bearer resources\n    on the S-GW reserved.\n\n     The SGSN releases the non-accepted EPS Bearer contexts by triggering\n    the EPS Bearer context deactivation procedure. If the Serving GW\n    receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops\n    the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the\n    SGSN.\n\n  10.  The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) may inform the PDN GW the change of, for example, for\n    Serving GW relocation or the RAT type, that e.g. can be used for\n    charging, by sending the message Modify Bearer Request per PDN\n    connection. The S-GW also includes User Location Information IE and/or\n    UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE if they are present in\n    step\u00a09. Serving Network should be included if it is received in step\u00a09\n    or in step\u00a04 in clause\u00a05.5.2.3.2. For Serving GW relocation, the\n    Serving GW allocates DL TEIDs on S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers\n    and may include the PDN Charging Pause Supported Indication. The PDN GW\n    must acknowledge the request with the message Modify Bearer Response.\n    In the case of Serving GW relocation, the PDN GW updates its context\n    field and returns a Modify Bearer Response (Charging Id, MSISDN, PDN\n    Charging Pause Enabled Indication (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the\n    function), etc.) message to the Serving GW. The MSISDN is included if\n    the PDN GW has it stored in its UE context. If location information\n    change reporting is required and supported in the target SGSN, the PDN\n    GW shall provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in the Modify Bearer\n    Response.\n\n     If PCC infrastructure is used, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the\n    change of, for example, the RAT type.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path.\n    The source Serving GW shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the\n    source eNodeB.\n\n  11.  The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) acknowledges the user plane switch to the Target SGSN via\n    the message Modify Bearer Response (Cause, Serving GW Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, Serving GW Address for Control Plane,\n    Protocol Configuration Options, MS Info Change Reporting Action). At\n    this stage the user plane path is established for all EPS Bearer\n    contexts between the UE, Target BSS, Target SGSN, Serving GW (for\n    Serving GW relocation this will be the Target Serving GW) and PDN GW.\n\n     If the Serving GW does not change, the Serving GW shall send one or\n    more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching\n    the path.\n\n  12.  If the Target SGSN indicated XID Reset (i.e. reset to default XID\n    parameters) in the NAS container included in the HO from E-UTRAN\n    Command message, then on receipt of the PS Handover Complete the Target\n    SGSN initiates an LLC/SNDCP XID negotiation for each LLC SAPI used in\n    LLC ADM. In this case if the Target SGSN wants to use the default XID\n    parameters, it shall send an empty XID Command. If the Target SGSN\n    indicated 'Reset to the old XID parameters' in the NAS container, no\n    further XID negotiation is required for LLC SAPIs used in LLC ADM only.\n\n  12a. The Target SGSN (re-)establishes LLC ABM for the EPS Bearer contexts\n    which use acknowledged information transfer. During the exchange of\n    SABM and UA the SGSN shall perform LLC/SNDCP XID negotiation.\n\n     These steps (12 and 12a) are the same as specified in clause 5.3.2.2\n    in TS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8].\n\n  13.  After the UE has finished the reconfiguration procedure the UE shall\n    initiate the Routing Area Update procedure.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  The RAU procedure is performed regardless if the UE has this\n         routing area registered or not, as specified by TS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8]. This\n         is needed e.g. to update the START-PS value stored in the 2G-SGSN.\n         The START_PS is delivered to SGSN in INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO\n         parameter of RAU Complete message when requested by SGSN in RAU\n         Accepted.\n\n     The target SGSN knows that an IRAT Handover has been performed for\n    this UE as it received the bearer context(s) by handover messages and\n    therefore the target SGSN performs only a subset of the RAU procedure,\n    specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures between source\n    MME and target SGSN.\n\n     For a UE supporting CIoT EPS Optimisations, the UE uses the bearer\n    status information in the RAU Accept to identify any non-transferred\n    bearers that it shall locally release.\n\n  13a. Upon reception of the PS Handover Complete message with the 'Request\n    for Inter RAT Handover Info' set to '1', the SGSN should send then PS\n    Handover Complete Acknowledge (TLLI, INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO) to the\n    target BSS.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  An SGSN that does not recognize the \"Request for Inter RAT\n         Handover Info\" in the PS Handover Complete message will not send\n         the PS Handover Complete Acknowledge message back to the BSS.\n\n     The target BSS receiving the PS Handover Complete Acknowledge message\n    shall set the 'Reliable INTER RAT HANDOVER' to '1' in the PS Handover\n    Required message in any subsequent PS handover to GERAN A/Gb mode. The\n    target BSS failing to receive the PS Handover Complete Acknowledge\n    message shall set the 'Reliable INTER RAT HANDOVER' to '0' in the PS\n    Handover Required message in any subsequent PS handover to GERAN A/Gb\n    mode. The Target BSS shall, upon receipt of the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO\n    in the PS Handover Complete Acknowledge message, overwrite its current\n    INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO with this new one.\n\n  14.  When the timer started at step\u00a08 expires, the source MME sends a\n    Release Resources message to the source eNodeB. The Source eNodeB\n    releases its resources related to the UE.\n\n     When the timer started in step 8 expires and if the source MME\n    received the Serving GW change indication in the Forward Relocation\n    Response message, it deletes the EPS bearer resources by sending Delete\n    Session Request (Cause, Operation Indication, Secondary RAT usage data)\n    messages to the Source Serving GW. The operation Indication flag is not\n    set, that indicates to the Source Serving GW that the Serving GW\n    changes and the Source Serving GW shall not initiate a delete procedure\n    towards the PDN GW. Secondary RAT usage data is included if it was\n    received in step\u00a03. The Source Serving GW acknowledges with Delete\n    Session Response (Cause) messages. If ISR has been activated before\n    this procedure, the cause indicates to the Source S-GW that the Source\n    S-GW shall delete the bearer resources on the other old CN node by\n    sending Delete Bearer Request message(s) to that CN node.\n\n  15.  If indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at\n    source MME started at step\u00a08 triggers the source MME to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the S-GW to release\n    the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding.\n\n  16.  If indirect forwarding was used and the Serving GW is relocated,\n    then the expiry of the timer at target SGSN started at step\u00a08 triggers\n    the target SGSN to send a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Request message to the target S-GW to release temporary resources used\n    for indirect forwarding.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT handover reject", "numbering": "5.5.2.3.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.3.4   E-UTRAN to GERAN A/Gb mode Inter RAT handover reject\n\nThe Target BSS may reject the use of the Handover procedure if none of the\nrequested PFCs in the PS Handover Request message could be established. In\nthis case no UE context is established in the target SGSN/BSS and no\nresources are allocated.

The source access system, Source BSS, decides to initiate an Inter-RAT\n    Handover to the E-UTRAN. At this point both uplink and downlink user\n    data is transmitted via the following: Bearers between UE and Source\n    BSS, BSSGP PFC tunnel(s) between source BSS and source SGSN, GTP\n    tunnel(s) between Source SGSN, Serving GW and PDN GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The process leading to the handover decision is outside of the\n         scope of this specification.\n\n  2. The source BSS sends the message PS handover Required (TLLI, Cause,\n    Source Cell Identifier, Target eNodeB Identifier, Source eNodeB to\n    Target eNodeB Transparent Container and active PFCs list) to Source\n    SGSN to request the CN to establish resources in the Target eNodeB,\n    Target MME and the Serving GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  In contrast to most inter-RAT handover preparation phases, this\n         Source to Target Transparent Container does not contain the UE's\n         target RAT radio capabilities.\n\n  3. The Source SGSN determines from the 'Target eNodeB Identifier' IE that\n    the type of handover is IRAT PS Handover to E-UTRAN. The Source SGSN\n    selects the Target MME as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.3 on \"MME Selection\n    Function\". The Source SGSN initiates the Handover resource allocation\n    procedure by sending message Forward Relocation Request (IMSI, Target\n    Identification, MM Context, PDN Connections, SGSN Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, SGSN Address for Control plane, Source to\n    Target Transparent Container, RAN Cause, Packet Flow ID, SNDCP XID\n    parameters, LLC XID parameters, MS Info Change Reporting Action (if\n    available), CSG Information Reporting Action (if available), UE Time\n    Zone, ISR Supported, Serving Network) to the target MME. When ISR is\n    activated the message should be sent to the MME that maintains ISR for\n    the UE when this MME is serving the target identified by the Target\n    Identification. If indicated, the information ISR Supported indicates\n    that the source SGSN and associated Serving GW are capable to activate\n    ISR for the UE. This message includes all PDN Connections active in the\n    source system and for each PDN Connection includes the associated APN,\n    the address and the uplink tunnel endpoint parameters of the Serving GW\n    for control plane, and a list of EPS Bearer Contexts established in the\n    source system. The EPS Bearer Contexts indicate the PFIs and the XID\n    parameters related to those EPS Bearer Contexts, and the uplink Tunnel\n    endpoint parameters of the Serving GW. The old Serving Network is sent\n    to target MME to support the target MME to resolve if Serving Network\n    is changed. In network sharing scenarios Serving Network denotes the\n    serving core network.\n\n     The RAN Cause includes the value from the Cause IE received from the\n    source BSS. Source to Target Transparent Container includes the value\n    from the Source eNodeB to Target eNodeB Transparent Container received\n    from the source BSS.\n\n     The MM context includes information on the EPS Bearer context(s). If\n    none of the UE's EPS Bearers can be supported by the selected target\n    MME, the source SGSN rejects the handover attempt by sending a PS\n    Handover Required Negative Acknowledge (Cause) message to the Source\n    BSS.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If the handover is successful, the source SGSN will signal to\n         the SGW and/or SCEF to release any non-included EPS Bearers after\n         step\u00a06 of the Execution procedure. The non-included bearers are\n         locally released by the UE following the Bearer Context Status\n         synchronisation that occurs during the Tracking Area Update at\n         step\u00a012 of the Execution procedure.\n\n     Prioritization of EPS Bearer Contexts is performed by the target core\n    network node.\n\n     The MME establishes the EPS bearer(s) in the prioritized order. The\n    MME deactivates, as provided in step\u00a08 of the execution phase, the EPS\n    bearers which cannot be established.\n\n     The MM context contains security related information, e.g. supported\n    ciphering algorithms as described in TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[43]. Handling of\n    security keys is described in TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[41].\n\n     For the EPS Bearer Context with traffic class equals 'Background', the\n    source SGSN shall indicate via the Activity Status Indicator IE that\n    radio bearers shall be established on the target side.\n\n     The target MME shall determine the Maximum APN restriction based on\n    the APN Restriction of each bearer context received in the Forward\n    Relocation Request, and shall subsequently store the new Maximum APN\n    restriction value.\n\n  4. The target MME determines if the Serving GW is to be relocated, e.g.\n    due to PLMN change. If the Serving GW is to be relocated, the target\n    MME selects the target Serving GW as described under clause 4.3.8.2 on\n    \"Serving GW selection function\". The target MME sends a Create Session\n    Request message (IMSI, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control\n    Plane, MME Address for Control plane, PDN GW address(es) for user\n    plane, PDN GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, PDN GW address for control\n    plane, and PDN GW TEID(s) for control plane, the Protocol Type over\n    S5/S8, Serving Network) per PDN connection to the target Serving GW.\n    The Protocol Type over S5/S8 is provided to Serving GW which protocol\n    should be used over S5/S8 interface.\n\n  4a.  The target Serving GW allocates its local resources and returns them\n    in a Create Session Response (Serving GW address(es) for user plane,\n    Serving GW UL TEID(s) for user plane, Serving GW Address for control\n    plane, Serving GW TEID for control plane) message to the target MME.\n\n  5. The Target MME will request the Target eNodeB to establish the\n    Bearer(s) by sending the message Handover Request (UE Identifier, S1AP\n    Cause, Integrity protection information (i.e. IK and allowed Integrity\n    Protection algorithms), Encryption information (i.e. CK and allowed\n    Ciphering algorithms), EPS Bearers to be setup list, Source to Target\n    Transparent Container, Handover Restriction List). The Target MME\n    ignores any Activity Status Indicator within an EPS Bearer Context and\n    requests the eNodeB to allocate resources for all EPS Bearer Contexts\n    received from the source side. The S1AP Cause includes the value from\n    the RAN Cause IE received from the source SGSN. The target eNodeB shall\n    ignore it if the number of radio bearers in the Source to Target\n    Transparent container does not comply with the number of bearers\n    requested by the MME and allocate bearers as requested by the MME.\n    Handover Restriction List is sent if it is available in the Target MME;\n    it is described in clause\u00a04.3.5.7.\n\n     For each EPS bearer requested to be established, 'EPS Bearers To Be\n    Setup' IE shall contain information such as ID, bearer parameters,\n    Transport Layer Address, \"Data forwarding not possible\" indication, and\n    S1 Transport Association. The Transport Layer Address is the Serving GW\n    Address for user data, and the S1 Transport Association corresponds to\n    the uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data. \"Data forwarding not\n    possible\" indication shall be included if the target MME decides the\n    corresponding bearer will not be subject to data forwarding.\n\n     The ciphering and integrity protection keys will be sent transparently\n    from the target eNodeB to the UE in the Target to Source Transparent\n    Container, and in the message PS Handover Command from source BSS to\n    the UE. This will then allow data transfer to continue in the new\n    RAT/mode target cell without requiring a new AKA (Authentication and\n    Key Agreement) procedure.

Upon sending the\n    Handover Request Acknowledge message the target eNodeB shall be\n    prepared to receive downlink GTP PDUs from the Serving GW for the\n    accepted EPS bearers.\n\n  6. If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation of Serving GW apply, the\n    target MME sends a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request\n    message (Target eNodeB Address(es) and TEID(s) for DL data forwarding)\n    to the Serving GW.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  6a.  The Serving GW returns a Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel\n    Response (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and DL TEID(s) for data\n    forwarding) message to the target MME.\n\n  7. The Target MME sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause,\n    List of Set Up PFCs, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane,\n    RAN Cause, MME Address for control plane, Target to Source Transparent\n    Container, Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding, Serving GW\n    change indication) to the Source SGSN. Serving GW change indication\n    indicates whether a new Serving GW has been selected. The RAN Cause\n    includes the value from the S1AP Cause IE received from the target\n    eNodeB. The Target to Source Transparent Container includes the value\n    from the Target to Source Transparent Container received from the\n    target eNodeB.\n\n     If 'Direct Forwarding' applies or if 'Indirect Forwarding' but no\n    relocation of Serving GW applies, then the IEs 'Address(es) and TEID(s)\n    for Data Forwarding' contain the DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to\n    the eNodeB received in step\u00a05a. If 'Indirect Forwarding' and relocation\n    of Serving GW apply the IEs 'Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data\n    Forwarding' contain the DL GTP-U tunnel endpoint parameters to the\n    Serving GW received in step\u00a06a.\n\n  8. If 'Indirect Forwarding' applies, the source SGSN shall send the\n    message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request (Address(es) and\n    TEID(s) for Data Forwarding (received in step\u00a07)) to the Serving GW\n    used for indirect packet forwarding.\n\n     Indirect forwarding may be performed via a Serving GW which is\n    different from the Serving GW used as the anchor point for the UE.\n\n  8a.  The Serving GW returns the forwarding user plane parameters by\n    sending the message Create Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Response\n    (Cause, Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for Data Forwarding). If the\n    Serving GW doesn't support data forwarding, an appropriate cause value\n    shall be returned and the Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) will not\n    be included in the message.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "Execution phase", "numbering": "5.5.2.4.3", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.4.3   Execution phase\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n   Figure 5.5.2.4.3-1: GERAN A/Gb mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT HO, execution\n                                    phase\n\n  NOTE:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].

The Source SGSN completes the preparation phase towards Source BSS by\n    sending the message PS HO Required Acknowledge (TLLI, List of Set Up\n    PFCs, Target RNC to Source BSS Transparent Container, Cause). This\n    message includes all PFIs that could be established on the Target side.\n    The Cause includes the value from the RAN Cause IE received from the\n    target MME. The Target RNC to Source BSS Transparent Container includes\n    the value from the Target to Source Transparent Container received from\n    the target MME.\n\n     Before sending the PS Handover Required Acknowledge message, the\n    source SGSN may suspend downlink data transfer for any EPS Bearer\n    contexts.\n\n     Before sending the PS Handover Command message to the UE the source\n    BSS, may try to empty the downlink BSS buffer for any BSS PFCs.\n\n  2. The Source BSS will command the UE to handover to the target eNodeB\n    via the message PS Handover Command. The access system specific message\n    to UE includes a transparent container including radio aspect\n    parameters that the Target eNodeB has set-up in the preparation phase.\n\n  3. Void.\n\n  4. The UE moves to the E-UTRAN and performs access procedures toward\n    Target eNodeB.\n\n  5. When the UE has got access to Target eNodeB it sends the message HO to\n    E-UTRAN Complete.\n    The UE shall implicitly derive the EPS bearers for which an E-RAB was\n    not established from the PS Handover Command and deactivate them\n    locally without an explicit NAS message at this step.\n\n  6. When the UE has successfully accessed the Target eNodeB, the Target\n    eNodeB informs the Target MME by sending the message Handover Notify\n    (TAI+ECGI). As a separate activity the Target eNodeB retrieves the UE E-\n    UTRA capability information using the procedure for UE Radio Capability\n    Handling (see clause\u00a05.11.2).\n\n     If Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the PSCell ID shall be\n    included in the Handover Notify message.\n\n  7. Then the Target MME knows that the UE has arrived to the target side\n    and Target MME informs the Source SGSN by sending the Forward\n    Relocation Complete Notification (ISR Activated, Serving GW change)\n    message. If indicated, ISR Activated indicates to the source SGSN that\n    it shall maintain the UE's contexts and activate ISR, which is only\n    possible when the S-GW is not changed. The Source SGSN shall also\n    acknowledge that information. When the Forward Relocation Complete\n    Notification message has been received and there is no longer any need\n    for the SGSN to forward data, the SGSN stops data forwarding. A timer\n    in source SGSN is started to supervise when resources in the Source\n    Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation) shall be released.\n\n     Upon receipt of the Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge message\n    the target MME starts a timer if the target MME applies indirect\n    forwarding.\n\n  8. The Target MME will now complete the Handover procedure by informing\n    the Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) that the Target MME is now responsible for all the EPS\n    bearers the UE have established. This is performed in the message\n    Modify Bearer Request (Cause, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for\n    Control Plane, EPS Bearer ID(s), MME Address for Control Plane, eNodeB\n    Address(es) and TEID(s) for User Traffic for the accepted EPS bearers\n    and RAT type, ISR Activated) per PDN connection. As it is a mobility\n    from GERAN, if the target MME supports location information change\n    reporting, the target MME shall include the User Location Information\n    (according to the supported granularity) in the Modify Bearer Request,\n    regardless of whether location information change reporting had been\n    requested in the previous RAT by the PDN GW. If the PDN GW requested\n    User CSG information (determined from the UE context), the MME also\n    includes the User CSG Information IE in this message. If the UE Time\n    Zone has changed, the MME includes the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\n    If the Serving GW is not relocated but the Serving Network has changed\n    or if the MME has not received any old Serving Network information from\n    the old SGSN, the MME includes the new Serving Network IE in this\n    message. If indicated, ISR Activated indicates that ISR is activated,\n    which is only possible when the S-GW was not changed. When the Modify\n    Bearer Request does not indicate ISR Activated and S-GW is not changed,\n    the S-GW deletes any ISR resources by sending a Delete Bearer Request\n    to the other CN node that has bearer resources on the S-GW reserved.\n\n     The MME releases the non-accepted dedicated bearers by triggering the\n    bearer release procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.4.4.2. If the Serving\n    GW receives a DL packet for a non-accepted bearer, the Serving GW drops\n    the DL packet and does not send a Downlink Data Notification to the\n    MME.\n\n     If the default bearer of a PDN connection has not been accepted by the\n    target eNodeB and there are other PDN connections active, the MME shall\n    handle it in the same way as if all bearers of a PDN connection have\n    not been accepted. The MME releases these PDN connections by triggering\n    the MME requested PDN disconnection procedure specified in\n    clause\u00a05.10.3.\n\n  9. The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) informs the PDN GW(s) the change of, for example, for\n    Serving GW relocation or the RAT type, that e.g. can be used for\n    charging, by sending the message Modify Bearer Request per PDN\n    connection. The S-GW also includes User Location Information IE and/or\n    UE Time Zone IE and/or User CSG Information IE if they are present in\n    step\u00a08. Serving Network should be included if it is received in step\u00a08\n    or in step\u00a04 in clause\u00a05.5.2.4.2. For Serving GW relocation, the\n    Serving GW allocates DL TEIDs on S5/S8 even for non-accepted bearers\n    and PDN Charging Pause Support Indication shall be included. The PDN GW\n    must acknowledge the request with the message Modify Bearer Response\n    (Charging Id, MSISDN, PDN Charging Pause Enabled Indication (if PDN GW\n    has chosen to enable the function), etc.) to the Serving GW. If\n    location information change reporting is required and supported in the\n    target MME, the PDN GW shall provide MS Info Change Reporting Action in\n    the Modify Bearer Response.\n\n     If PCC infrastructure is used, the PDN GW informs the PCRF about the\n    change of, for example, the RAT type.\n\n     If the Serving GW is relocated, the PDN GW shall send one or more \"end\n    marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching the path in\n    order to assist the reordering function in the target eNodeB. The\n    source Serving GW shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the source\n    SGSN.\n\n  10.  The Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the Target\n    Serving GW) acknowledges the user plane switch to the Target MME via\n    the message Modify Bearer Response (Cause, Serving GW Tunnel Endpoint\n    Identifier for Control Plane, Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation\n    this will be the Target Serving GW) Address for Control Plane, Protocol\n    Configuration Options, MS Info Change Reporting Action). At this stage\n    the user plane path is established for all bearers between the UE,\n    Target eNodeB, Serving GW (for Serving GW relocation this will be the\n    Target Serving GW) and PDN GW.\n\n     If the Serving GW does not change, the Serving GW shall send one or\n    more \"end marker\" packets on the old path immediately after switching\n    the path in order to assist the reordering function in the target\n    eNodeB.\n\n  11.  When the timer at the source SGSN started in step 7 expires the\n    Source SGSN will clean-up all its resources towards Source BSS by\n    performing the BSS Packet Flow Delete procedure.\n\n  12.  The UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure when one of the\n    conditions listed in clause \"Triggers for tracking area update\"\n    applies.\n\n     The target MME knows that an IRAT Handover has been performed for this\n    UE as it received the bearer context(s) by handover messages and\n    therefore the target MME performs only a subset of the TA update\n    procedure, specifically it excludes the context transfer procedures\n    between source SGSN and target MME.\n\n     If the Subscription Data received from the HSS (during the TAU in\n    step\u00a012) contains information that is necessary for the E-UTRAN to be\n    aware of (e.g. a restriction in the UE's permission to use NR as a\n    secondary RAT, Unlicensed Spectrum or a combination of them), or an\n    existing UE context in the MME indicates that the UE is not permitted\n    to use NR as a secondary RAT, Unlicensed Spectrum or a combination of\n    them and the MME has not provided this information to the target eNodeB\n    during step\u00a05 of the handover preparation phase, then the MME sends an\n    updated Handover Restriction List in the Downlink NAS Transport message\n    that it sends to E-UTRAN. If the UE is not allowed to use NR as\n    Secondary RAT, the MME indicates that to the UE in TAU Accept message.\n\n  13.  When the timer at the source SGSN started in step\u00a07 expires and if\n    the source SGSN received the Serving GW change indication in the\n    Forward Relocation Response message, it deletes the EPS bearer\n    resources by sending Delete Session Request (Cause, Operation\n    Indication) messages to the Source Serving GW. The operation Indication\n    flag is not set, that indicates to the Source Serving GW that the\n    Source Serving GW shall not initiate a delete procedure towards the PDN\n    GW. The Source Serving GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response\n    (Cause) messages. If ISR has been activated before this procedure, the\n    cause indicates to the Source S-GW that the Source S-GW shall delete\n    the bearer resources on the other old CN node by sending Delete Bearer\n    Request message(s) to that CN node.\n\n  14.  If indirect forwarding was used then the expiry of the timer at\n    source SGSN started at step\u00a07 triggers the source SGSN to send a Delete\n    Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request message to the S-GW to release\n    the temporary resources used for indirect forwarding.\n\n  15.  If indirect forwarding was used and the Serving GW is relocated,\n    then the expiry of the timer at target MME started at step\u00a06 triggers\n    the target MME to send a Delete Indirect Data Forwarding Tunnel Request\n    message to the target S-GW to release temporary resources used for\n    indirect forwarding.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "GERAN A/Gb mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT handover reject", "numbering": "5.5.2.4.4", "title_level": 4, "desc": "5.5.2.4.4   GERAN A/Gb mode to E-UTRAN Inter RAT handover reject\n\nThe Target eNodeB may reject the use of the Handover procedure if none of\nthe requested EPS bearers in the Handover Request message could be\nestablished.

The following steps are applied to all MMEs serving the\ncongested eNB or E-UTRAN cell.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  In network sharing scenarios the RCAF belongs to the RAN\n         operator. In this case it is up to inter-operator agreements and\n         operator configuration which sharing partner's MMEs the RCAF\n         queries IMSI and APN information from.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n        Figure 5.9.3-1: IMSI and APN information retrieval procedure\n\n  1. The RCAF sends an IMSI/APN information request to the MME. The request\n    shall identify whether the request refers to an eNB or an E-UTRAN cell\n    and shall contain the related eNB ID or ECGI.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  The eNB ID is defined in TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36].\n\n  2. The MME sends the IMSI/APN information response to the RCAF. The\n    response shall contain the list of UEs (identified by the IMSIs) served\n    by the eNB or E-UTRAN cell and the list of APNs of the active PDN\n    connections of each IMSI.\n\n     If the RCAF requested the IMSI/APN information on E-UTRAN cell level,\n    then the MME first determines the list of UEs served by that E-UTRAN\n    cell. The MME may achieve this by querying the eNB that the E-UTRAN\n    cell belongs to for the exact ECGI for all UEs served by this eNB using\n    the Location Reporting procedure (clause\u00a05.9.1).\n\n  NOTE\u00a04: Applying the Location Reporting feature due to an E-UTRAN cell\n         level RCAF request can increase S1-MME interface signalling load.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  In order for RCAF to maintain the list of impacted UEs\n         (identified by the IMSIs) (and related APN information) for a\n         congested cell, the RCAF needs to regularly receive IMSI/APN\n         information updates from the MME.

The UE initiates the UE Requested PDN procedure by the transmission of\n    a PDN Connectivity Request (APN, PDN Type, Protocol Configuration\n    Options, Request Type, Header Compression Configuration) message. If\n    the UE was in ECM-IDLE mode, this NAS message is preceded by the\n    Service Request procedure if any of the exiting PDN connections were\n    using the User Plane without CIoT EPS Optimisation, or, if the user\n    plane was used just with User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisations, a\n    Connection Resume Procedure is executed instead. PDN type indicates the\n    requested IP version (IPv4, IPv4v6, IPv6, Non-IP, Ethernet).\n\n     The MME verifies that the APN provided by UE is allowed by\n    subscription. If the APN provided by the UE is not allowed by\n    subscription, based on operator policy, the MME may reject the request\n    from the UE with an appropriate cause, or accept the request by\n    replacing the UE requested APN with a network supported APN. The MME\n    uses that network supported APN for the remainder of this procedure,\n    except that the MME provides to the UE the same APN that the UE\n    requested. If the UE did not provide an APN, the MME shall use the APN\n    from the default PDN subscription context, and, use this APN for the\n    remainder of this procedure.\n\n     Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) are used to transfer parameters\n    between the UE and the Network and are sent transparently through the\n    MME and the Serving GW. The Protocol Configuration Options may include\n    the Address Allocation Preference, which indicates that the UE prefers\n    to obtain an IPv4 address only after the default bearer activation by\n    means of DHCPv4. If the UE has UTRAN or GERAN capabilities, it shall\n    send the NRSU in the PCO to indicate the support of the network\n    requested bearer control in UTRAN/GERAN. The UE sends the ETFTU in the\n    PCO to indicate the support of the extended TFT filter format. The\n    Request Type indicates \"initial request\" if the UE requests new\n    additional PDN connectivity over the 3GPP access network for multiple\n    PDN connections, the Request Type indicates \"handover\" when the UE is\n    performing a handover from non-3GPP access and the UE has already\n    established connectivity with the PDN over the non-3GPP access.\n\n     The UE shall indicate Request Type \"Emergency\" when it requests a PDN\n    connection for emergency services.\n\n     If the message is being sent via a HeNB which has a collocated L-GW,\n    it includes the L-GW address in the Uplink NAS transport message to the\n    MME.\n\n     If a UE indicated Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation supported in\n    Preferred Network Behavior and supports header compression, it shall\n    include the Header Compression Configuration, unless \"Non-IP\" or\n    \"Ethernet\" PDN type is indicated. The Header Compression Configuration\n    includes the information necessary for the ROHC channel setup.\n    Optionally, the Header Compression Configuration may also include\n    additional header compression context setup parameters, if the UE\n    already has the application traffic information, e.g. the target server\n    IP address.\n\n     The UE shall include in the PCO the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status, which\n    indicates whether the user has activated or deactivated 3GPP PS Data\n    Off.\n\n  2. If the MME receives a PDN Connectivity Request from an emergency\n    attached or RLOS attached UE or the PDN Connectivity Request is for\n    normal services and the mobility or access restrictions do not allow\n    the UE to access normal services the MME shall reject this request.\n\n     If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency\" and the MME is not\n    configured to support PDN connections for emergency services the MME\n    shall reject the PDN Connectivity Request with an appropriate reject\n    cause.\n\n     If the Request Type is not set to \"Emergency\", and the UE has\n    indicated support for Attach without PDN Connectivity, and the network\n    supports Attach without PDN Connectivity, and the PDN Connection\n    Restriction is set in the subscriber data, then the MME should reject\n    the PDN Connectivity Request with an appropriate cause value.\n\n     If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency\", the MME derives a PDN GW\n    from the MME Emergency Configuration Data or the MME selects a PDN GW\n    as described in clause\u00a04.3.12.4 on PDN GW Selection Function (3GPP\n    accesses) according to the Emergency APN in the MME Emergency\n    Configuration Data. This selection shall provide a PDN GW from visited\n    PLMN only.\n\n     If the Request Type indicates \"Emergency\" and the MME is configured to\n    support PDN connections for emergency services, it uses the MME\n    Emergency Configuration Data for the bearer establishment in this step\n    and ignores any subscription data limitation.\n\n     If the Request Type indicates \"Handover\", the MME uses the PDN GW\n    stored in the Subscription Data retrieved by the MME during the Update\n    Location performed at attach. If the Request Type indicates \"initial\n    request\" the MME selects a PDN GW as described in clause\u00a04.3.8.1 on PDN\n    GW Selection Function (3GPP accesses).\n\n     If the UE provided APN is authorized for LIPA according to the user\n    subscription, the MME shall use the CSG Subscription Data to authorize\n    the connection.\n\n     If the subscription context does not indicate that the APN is for a\n    PDN connection to an SCEF the MME allocates a Bearer Id, and sends a\n    Create Session Request (IMSI, MSISDN, MME TEID for control plane, RAT\n    type, LTE-M RAT type reporting to PGW flag, PDN GW address, PDN\n    Address, Default EPS Bearer QoS, PDN Type, subscribed APN-AMBR, APN,\n    EPS Bearer Id, Protocol Configuration Options, Handover Indication, ME\n    Identity, User Location Information (ECGI), UE Time Zone, User CSG\n    Information, MS Info Change Reporting support indication, Selection\n    Mode, Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger\n    Id, OMC Identity, Maximum APN Restriction, Dual Address Bearer Flag)\n    message to the Serving GW. If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\n    applies, then the MME shall also indicate S11-U tunnelling of NAS user\n    data and send its own S11-U IP address and MME DL TEID for DL data\n    forwarding by the SGW.\n\n     If the MME determines the PDN connection shall only use the Control\n    Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, the MME shall include a Control Plane Only\n    PDN Connection Indicator in Create Session Request.\n\n     For PDN type \"non-IP\", if the APN subscription data indicate a SCEF\n    connection needs to be used, then the MME allocates an EPS Bearer\n    Identity for the Default Bearer associated with the UE and established\n    connection to the SCEF address indicated in subscription data according\n    to TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] and the steps 2,3,4,5,6 are not executed. The rest of\n    the interactions with the UE apply as specified below.\n\n     The RAT type is provided in this message for the later PCC decision.\n    The RAT type shall enable NB-IoT, LTE-M and WB-E-UTRAN to be\n    differentiated by the PDN-GW The MSISDN is included if the MME has it\n    stored for that UE. Handover Indication is included if the Request Type\n    indicates \"handover\". Selection Mode indicates whether a subscribed APN\n    was selected, or a non-subscribed APN sent by the UE was selected. The\n    P-GW may use Selection Mode when deciding whether to accept or reject\n    the default bearer activation. For example, if an APN requires\n    subscription, the P-GW is configured to accept only the default bearer\n    activation that requests a subscribed APN as indicated by Selection\n    Mode. Charging Characteristics indicates which kind of charging the\n    bearer context is liable for.\n\n     The charging characteristics for the PS subscription and individually\n    subscribed APNs as well as the way of handling Charging Characteristics\n    and whether to send them or not to the P-GW is defined in\n    TS\u00a032.251\u00a0[44]. The MME shall include Trace Reference, Trace Type,\n    Trigger Id, and OMC Identity if S-GW and/or P-GW trace is activated.\n    The MME shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, and OMC Identity from\n    the trace information received from the HLR or OMC.\n\n     The Maximum APN Restriction denotes the most stringent restriction as\n    required by any already active bearer context. If there are no already\n    active bearer contexts, this value is set to the least restrictive type\n    (see clause\u00a015.4 of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]). If the P-GW receives the Maximum\n    APN Restriction, then the P-GW shall check if the Maximum APN\n    Restriction value does not conflict with the APN Restriction value\n    associated with this bearer context request. If there is no conflict\n    the request shall be allowed, otherwise the request shall be rejected\n    with sending an appropriate error cause to the UE.\n\n     If the PDN subscription context contains a subscribed IPv4 address\n    and/or IPv6 prefix, the MME indicates it in the PDN address. The MME\n    may change the requested PDN type according to the subscription data\n    for this APN as described in clause\u00a05.3.1.1. The MME shall set the Dual\n    Address Bearer Flag when the PDN type is set to IPv4v6 and all SGSNs\n    which the UE may be handed over to are Release\u00a08 or above supporting\n    dual addressing, which is determined based on node pre-configuration by\n    the operator.\n\n     If there is an APN Rate Control Status in the MME MM Context for the\n    UE, the MME forwards it to the SGW.\n\n  3. The Serving GW creates a new entry in its EPS Bearer table and sends a\n    Create Session Request (IMSI, MSISDN, Serving GW Address for the user\n    plane, Serving GW TEID of the user plane, Serving GW TEID of the\n    control plane, RAT type, Default EPS Bearer QoS, PDN Type, PDN Address,\n    subscribed APN-AMBR, APN, Bearer Id, Protocol Configuration Options,\n    Handover Indication, ME Identity, User Location Information (ECGI), UE\n    Time Zone, User CSG Information, MS Info Change Reporting support\n    indication, PDN Charging Pause Support indication, Selection Mode,\n    Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC\n    Identity, Maximum APN Restriction, Dual Address Bearer Flag, APN Rate\n    Control Status) message to the PDN GW indicated in the PDN GW address\n    received in the previous step. After this step, the Serving GW buffers\n    any downlink packets it may receive from the PDN GW until receives the\n    message in step 13 below. The MSISDN is included if received from the\n    MME. If the Handover Indication is included, the Serving GW includes it\n    in the Create Session Request message.\n\n     If the Serving GW has received the Control Plane Only PDN Connection\n    Indicator in step\u00a02, the Serving GW informs the PDN GW this information\n    in Create Session Request. The Serving GW and PDN GW shall indicate the\n    use of CP only on their CDRs.\n\n     P-GWs shall not perform any checks of Maximum APN Restriction if\n    Create Default Bearer Request includes emergency APN.\n\n     If the PDN GW detects that the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status has changed,\n    the PDN GW shall indicate this event to the charging system for offline\n    and online charging.\n\n  4. If dynamic PCC is deployed and the Handover Indication is not present,\n    the PDN GW may employ an IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure as\n    defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] with the PCRF to get the default PCC rules for\n    the UE. This may lead to the establishment of a number of dedicated\n    bearers following the procedures defined in clause 5.4.1 in association\n    with the establishment of the default bearer which is described in\n    Annex\u00a0F.\n\n     The RAT type is provided to the PCRF by the PDN GW if received by the\n    previous message. If the PDN GW/PCEF is configured to activate\n    predefined PCC rules for the default bearer, the interaction with the\n    PCRF is not required (e.g. operator may configure to do this) at the\n    moment.\n\n     The ETFTU is provided to the PCRF by the PDN\u00a0GW, if received in the\n    PCO from the UE and the PDN\u00a0GW supports the extended TFT filter format.\n    If the PCRF decides that the PDN connection may use extended TFT\n    filters, it shall return the ETFTN indicator to the PDN\u00a0GW for\n    inclusion in the protocol Configuration Options returned to the UE.\n\n     The PCRF may modify the APN-AMBR and the QoS parameters (QCI and ARP)\n    associated with the default bearer in the response to the PDN GW as\n    defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n     If the PCC is configured to support emergency services and dynamic PCC\n    is deployed, the PCRF, based on the Emergency APN, sets the ARP of the\n    PCC rules to a value that is reserved for emergency services and the\n    authorization of dynamic PCC rules as described in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6]. If\n    dynamic PCC is not deployed, the PDN GW is configured to set the ARP to\n    a value that is reserved for emergency services.\n\n     If dynamic PCC is deployed and the Handover Indication is present, the\n    PDN GW executes a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure\n    with the PCRF as specified in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] to report the new IP-CAN\n    type. Depending on the active PCC rules, the establishment of dedicated\n    bearer for the UE may be required. The establishment of those bearers\n    shall take place in combination with the default bearer activation as\n    described in Annex F. This procedure can continue without waiting for a\n    PCRF response. If changes to the active PCC rules are required, the\n    PCRF may provide them after the handover procedure is finished.\n\n     In both cases (Handover Indication is present or not), if dynamic PCC\n    is not deployed, the PDN GW may apply local QoS policy. This may lead\n    to the establishment of a number of dedicated bearers for the UE\n    following the procedures defined in clause\u00a05.4.1 in combination with\n    the establishment of the default bearer, which is described in Annex\u00a0F.\n\n     If the CSG information reporting triggers are received from the PCRF,\n    the PDN GW should set the CSG Information Reporting Action IE\n    accordingly.\n\n     If 3GPP PS Data Off status is received in the PCO from the UE and PDN\n    GW supports 3GPP PS Data Off, the PDN GW shall provide the 3GPP PS Data\n    Off status to the PCRF. If the PCRF supports 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall\n    return 3GPP PS Data Off support to the PDN GW for inclusion in the PCO\n    returned to the UE.\n\n     If the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status indicates that 3GPP PS Data Off is\n    activated for the UE, the PDN GW shall enforce the PCC rules for\n    downlink traffic to be used when 3GPP PS Data Off is activated.\n\n     If received, the PDN GW may take the APN Rate Control Status into\n    account when encoding the APN Rate Control parameters in Protocol\n    Configuration Options and when enforcing the APN Rate Control as\n    described in clause\u00a04.7.7.3.\n\n  5. The P-GW creates a new entry in its EPS bearer context table and\n    generates a Charging Id for the Default Bearer. The new entry allows\n    the P-GW to route user plane PDUs between the S-GW and the packet data\n    network, and to start charging. The way the P-GW handles Charging\n    Characteristics that it may have received is defined in TS\u00a032.251\u00a0[44].\n\n     The PDN GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN GW Address for the\n    user plane, PDN GW TEID of the user plane, PDN GW TEID of the control\n    plane, PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Id, EPS Bearer QoS, Protocol\n    Configuration Options, Charging Id, Prohibit Payload Compression, APN\n    Restriction, Cause, MS Info Change Reporting Action (Start) (if the PDN\n    GW decides to receive UE's location information during the session),\n    CSG Information Reporting Action (Start) (if the PDN GW decides to\n    receive UE's User CSG information during the session), Presence\n    Reporting Area Action (if the PDN GW decides to receive notifications\n    about a change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area), PDN Charging\n    Pause Enabled indication (if PDN GW has chosen to enable the function),\n    APN-AMBR, Delay Tolerant Connection) message to the Serving GW. The PDN\n    GW takes into account the received PDN type, the Dual Address Bearer\n    Flag and the policies of operator when the PDN GW selects the PDN type\n    to be used as follows. If the received PDN type is IPv4v6 and both IPv4\n    and IPv6 addressing are possible in the PDN but the Dual Address Bearer\n    Flag is not set, or only single IP version addressing for this APN is\n    possible in the PDN, the PDN GW selects a single IP version (either\n    IPv4 or IPv6). If the received PDN type is IPv4 or IPv6, the PDN GW\n    uses the PDN type if it is supported in the PDN, otherwise an\n    appropriate error cause will be returned. The PDN GW allocates a PDN\n    Address according to the selected PDN Type If the PDN GW has selected a\n    PDN type different from the received PDN Type, the PDN GW indicates\n    together with the PDN type IE a reason cause to the UE why the PDN type\n    has been modified, as described in clause\u00a05.3.1.1. PDN Address may\n    contain an IPv4 address for IPv4 and/or an IPv6 prefix and an Interface\n    Identifier. If the PDN has been configured by the operator so that the\n    PDN addresses for the requested APN shall be allocated by usage of\n    DHCPv4 only, or if the PDN GW allows the UE to use DHCPv4 for address\n    allocation according to the Address Allocation Preference received from\n    the UE, the PDN Address shall be set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the\n    IPv4 address shall be negotiated by the UE with after completion of the\n    Default Bearer Activation procedure. For external PDN addressing for\n    IPv6, the PDN GW obtains the IPv6 prefix from the external PDN using\n    either RADIUS or Diameter client function. In the PDN Address field of\n    the Create Session Response, the PDN GW includes the Interface\n    Identifier and IPv6 prefix. The PDN GW sends Router Advertisement to\n    the UE after default bearer establishment with the IPv6 prefix\n    information for all cases. If the PDN address is contained in the\n    Create Session Request, the PDN GW shall allocate the IPv4 address\n    and/or IP6 prefix contained in the PDN address to the UE. If Handover\n    Indication indicates \"Handover\", the PDN Address Information shall\n    contain the same IP address the UE obtained during PDN connectivity\n    establishment over the non-3GPP access. The PDN GW derives the BCM\n    based on the NRSU and operator policy. The PDN\u00a0GW derives whether the\n    extended TFT filter format is to be used based on the ETFTU, ETFTN\n    received from the PCRF and operator policy. Protocol Configuration\n    Options contains the BCM, ETFTN as well as optional PDN parameters that\n    the P-GW may transfer to the UE. These optional PDN parameters may be\n    requested by the UE, or may be sent unsolicited by the P-GW. Protocol\n    Configuration Options are sent transparently through the MME.\n\n     If the PDN type is Non-IP or Ethernet, the PDN-GW uses the APN and\n    IMSI to determine what local actions to perform before answering the\n    Serving GW.\n\n     The PDN GW includes a Delay Tolerant Connection indication if the PDN\n    GW supports receiving a rejection cause from the SGW indicating that\n    the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving, and holding\n    mobile terminated procedures until the PDN GW receives a message\n    indicating that the UE is available for end to end signalling.\n\n     When the Handover Indication is present, the PDN GW does not yet send\n    downlink packets to the S-GW; the downlink path is to be switched at\n    step\u00a013a.\n\n     If the PDN GW is an L-GW, it does not forward downlink packets to the\n    S-GW. The packets will only be forwarded to the HeNB at step\u00a010 via the\n    direct user plane path for Local IP Access.\n\n     If the 3GPP PS Data Off UE Status was present in the Create Session\n    Request PCO, and if the network supports 3GPP PS Data Off, the PDN GW\n    shall include the 3GPP PS Data Off Support Indication in the Create\n    Session Response PCO.\n\n  6. The Serving GW returns a Create Session Response (PDN Type, PDN\n    Address, Serving GW address for User Plane, Serving GW TEID for User\n    Plane, Serving GW TEID for control plane, EPS Bearer Id, EPS Bearer\n    QoS, PDN GW address and TEID (GTP-based S5/S8) or GRE key (PMIP-based\n    S5/S8) at the PDN GW for uplink traffic, Protocol Configuration\n    Options, Prohibit Payload Compression, APN Restriction, Cause, MS Info\n    Change Reporting Action (Start), CSG Information Reporting Action\n    (Start), Presence Reporting Area Action, APN-AMBR, DTC) message to the\n    MME. The DL TFT for PMIP-based S5/S8 is obtained from interaction\n    between the Serving GW and the PCRF as described in clause 5.6.1 of\n    TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2], when PCC is deployed; otherwise, the DL TFT IE is\n    wildcarded, matching any downlink traffic. If the UE indicates the\n    Request Type as \"Handover\", this message also serves as an indication\n    to the MME that the S5/S8 bearer setup and update has been successful.\n    At this step the GTP tunnel(s) over S5/S8 are established\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies, and if MME doesn't\n    include Control Plane Only PDN Connection Indicator in the Create\n    Session Request:\n\n    -  If separation of S11-U from S1-U is required, the Serving GW shall\n       include the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U and additionally\n       the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S1-U in the Create Session\n       Response.\n\n    -  Otherwise if separation of S11-U from S1-U is not required, the\n       Serving GW includes the Serving GW IP address and TEID for S11-U in\n       Create Session Response.\n\n  7. If an APN Restriction is received, then the MME shall store this value\n    for the Bearer Context and the MME shall check this received value with\n    the stored value for the Maximum APN Restriction to ensure there are no\n    conflicts between values. If the consequence of this check results in\n    the PDN connectivity being rejected, the MME shall initiate a Bearer\n    Deactivation and return an appropriate error cause. If the PDN\n    Connectivity Request is accepted, the MME shall determine a (new) value\n    for the Maximum APN Restriction. If there is no previously stored value\n    for Maximum APN Restriction, then the Maximum APN Restriction shall be\n    set to the value of the received APN Restriction.\n\n     The P-GW shall ignore Maximum APN restriction if the request includes\n    the Emergency APN.\n\n     For emergency service MME shall not deactivate bearer(s), if present,\n    to maintain valid APN restriction combination.\n\n     If the MS Info Change Reporting Action (Start) and/or the CSG\n    Information Reporting Action (Start) are received for this bearer\n    context, then the MME shall store this for the bearer context and the\n    MME shall report to that P-GW via the S-GW whenever a UE's Location\n    Information and/or User CSG Information change occurs that meets the P-\n    GW request, as described in clause\u00a015.1.1a of TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[7]. If\n    Presence Reporting Area Action is received for this bearer context, the\n    MME shall store this information for the bearer context and shall\n    report to that P-GW via the S-GW whenever a change of UE presence in a\n    Presence Reporting Area is detected, as described in clause\u00a05.9.2.2.\n\n     The MME may need to modify the UE AMBR, which has been assigned to the\n    eNodeB, based on the subscribed UE-AMBR and the updated set of APN-\n    AMBRs in use. The principles to determine the UE-AMBR are described in\n    clause\u00a04.7.3.\n\n     The MME sends PDN Connectivity Accept Session Management Request (APN,\n    PDN Type, PDN Address, EPS Bearer Id, Protocol Configuration Options,\n    Header Compression Configuration, Control Plane Only Indicator) message\n    to the UE. If the PDN connection uses the user plane over the radio,\n    this message is contained in an S1_MME control message Bearer Setup\n    Request (EPS Bearer QoS, UE-AMBR, PDN Connectivity Accept, S1-TEID) to\n    the eNodeB. However, if Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies to\n    the PDN connection, an S1-AP Downlink NAS transport message is used.\n    The S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request message includes the TEID at\n    the Serving GW used for user plane and the address of the Serving GW\n    for user plane. If the PDN type is set to \"Non-IP\" the MME includes it\n    in the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request so that the eNodeB disables\n    header compression. If the PDN type is set to \"Ethernet\" the MME\n    includes it in the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request so that any\n    eNodeB header compression functionality can act appropriately. In\n    addition, if the PDN connection is established for Local IP Access, the\n    corresponding S1 Initial Context Setup Request message includes a\n    Correlation ID for enabling the direct user plane path between the HeNB\n    and the L-GW. If the PDN connection is established for SIPTO at the\n    Local Network with L-GW function collocated with the (H)eNB, the\n    corresponding S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request includes a SIPTO\n    Correlation ID for enabling the direct user plane path between the\n    (H)eNB and the L-GW. LIPA and SIPTO do not apply to Control Plane CIoT\n    EPS Optimisation.\n\n  NOTE\u00a05:  In this release of the 3GPP specification the Correlation ID and\n         SIPTO Correlation ID is set equal to the user plane PDN GW TEID\n         (GTP-based S5) or GRE key (PMIP-based S5) that the MME has received\n         in step\u00a06.\n\n     In the PDN Connectivity Accept message, the MME does not include the\n    IPv6 prefix within the PDN Address. The MME includes the APN-AMBR and\n    the EPS Bearer QoS parameter QCI into the Session Management Request.\n    Furthermore, if the UE has UTRAN or GERAN capabilities and the network\n    supports mobility to UTRAN or GERAN, the MME uses the EPS bearer QoS\n    parameters to derive the corresponding PDP context parameters QoS\n    Negotiated (R99 QoS profile), Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id and TI and\n    includes them in the Session Management Request. If the UE indicated in\n    the UE Network Capability that it does not support BSS packet flow\n    procedures, then the MME shall not include the Packet Flow Id. MME will\n    not send the S1 Bearer Setup Request message until any outstanding S1\n    Bearer Setup Response message for the same UE has been received or\n    timed out. If the APN-AMBR has changed the MME may update the UE-AMBR\n    if appropriate. The MME may include an indication whether the traffic\n    of this PDN Connection is allowed to be offloaded to WLAN, as described\n    in clause\u00a04.3.23. If the UE has indicated PDN type \"Non-IP\" or\n    \"Ethernet\", the MME and PDN GW shall not change PDN type.\n\n     If the MME or PDN GW has changed the PDN Type, an appropriate reason\n    cause shall be returned to the UE as described in clause\u00a05.3.1.1.\n\n     If Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies for an IP PDN\n    connection, and the UE has sent in the PDN Connectivity Request the\n    Header Compression Configuration, the MME shall include the Header\n    Compression Configuration in the PDN Connectivity Accept message. The\n    MME also binds the uplink and downlink ROHC channels to support header\n    compression feedback signalling. If the UE has included ROHC context\n    setup parameters in Header Compression Configuration in the PDN\n    Connectivity Request, the MME may acknowledge ROHC context setup\n    parameters. If the ROHC context is not established during the PDN\n    connection establishment procedure, before using the compressed format\n    for sending the data, the UE and the MME need to establish the ROHC\n    context with ROHC IR packet based on Header Compression Configuration.\n\n     If the MME based on local policy determines the PDN connection shall\n    only use the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, the MME shall include\n    a Control Plane Only Indicator in the Session Management Request. For\n    PDN connections with an SCEF, the MME shall always include the Control\n    Plane Only Indicator. If there is an existing SGi PDN connection for\n    this UE for which the MME included a Control Plane Only Indicator, the\n    MME shall include it also for the additional SGi PDN connection. If the\n    MME did not include a Control Plane Only Indicator for any of the\n    existing SGi PDN connections of this UE, the MME shall not include it\n    for the additional SGi PDN connection. A UE receiving the Control Plane\n    Only Indicator, for a PDN connection shall only use the Control Plane\n    CIoT EPS Optimisation for this PDN connection.\n\n  NOTE\u00a06:  The MME decision whether to include a Control Plane Only\n         Indicator to an SGi PDN connection for a UE that previously had no\n         SGi connections will impact other potential subsequent SGi PDN\n         connections for that UE.\n\n  8. If the eNodeB received an S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request, the\n    eNodeB sends RRC Connection Reconfiguration to the UE including the PDN\n    Connectivity Accept message.\n\n     If the eNodeB received an S1-AP Downlink NAS Transport message\n    containing the NAS PDN Connectivity Accept message, the eNode B sends a\n    RRC Direct Transfer message to the UE and the steps 9 and 10 are not\n    executed.\n\n     The UE shall store the QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id\n    and TI, which it received in the Session Management Request IE, for use\n    when accessing via GERAN or UTRAN. The UE may provide EPS Bearer QoS\n    parameters to the application handling the traffic flow. The\n    application usage of the EPS Bearer QoS is implementation dependent.\n    The UE shall not reject the RRC Connection Reconfiguration on the basis\n    of the EPS Bearer QoS parameters contained in the Session Management\n    Request.\n\n     If the UE receives an IPv4 address set to 0.0.0.0, it may negotiate\n    the IPv4 address with DHCPv4 as specified in TS\u00a029.061\u00a0[38], If the UE\n    receives an IPv6 interface identifier, it may wait for the Router\n    Advertisement from the network with the IPv6 prefix information or it\n    may send a Router Solicitation if necessary.\n\n  NOTE\u00a07:  The IP address allocation details are described in clause 5.3.1\n         on \"IP Address Allocation\".\n\n  9. The UE sends the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete to the\n    eNodeB.\n\n  10.  The eNodeB send an S1-AP Bearer Setup Response to the MME. The S1-AP\n    message includes the TEID of the eNodeB and the address of the eNodeB\n    used for downlink traffic on the S1_U reference point.\n\n     If the Correlation ID or SIPTO Correlation ID is included in the\n    Bearer Setup Request, the eNodeB shall use the included information to\n    establish a direct user plane path to the L-GW and forward uplink data\n    for Local IP Access or SIPTO at the Local Network with L-GW function\n    collocated with the (H)eNB accordingly.\n\n  11.  The UE NAS layer builds a PDN Connectivity Complete message\n    including EPS Bearer Identity. The UE then sends a Direct Transfer (PDN\n    Connectivity Complete) message to the eNodeB.\n\n  12.  The eNodeB sends an Uplink NAS Transport (PDN Connectivity Complete)\n    message to the MME.\n\n     After the PDN Connectivity Accept message and once the UE (if\n    applicable to the PDN type) has obtained a PDN Address Information, the\n    UE can then send uplink packets towards the eNodeB which may then be\n    tunnelled by the MME to the Serving GW and PDN GW, or transferred by\n    the MME to an SCEF (see TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74]), as per subscription\n    information related to APN discussed above in step\u00a02. If the UE\n    requested for a dual address PDN type (IPv4v6) to a given APN and was\n    granted a single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6) by the network with a\n    reason cause indicating that only single IP version per PDN connection\n    is allowed, the UE should request for the activation of a parallel PDN\n    connection to the same APN with a single address PDN type (IPv4 or\n    IPv6) other than the one already activated. If the UE receives no\n    reason cause in step 8 in response to a IPv4v6 PDN type and it receives\n    an IPv6 Interface Identifier apart from the IPv4 address or 0.0.0.0 in\n    the PDN Address field, it considers that the request for a dual address\n    PDN was successful. It can wait for the Router Advertisement from the\n    network with the IPv6 prefix information or it may send Router\n    Solicitation if necessary.\n\n  13.  Upon reception of the Bearer Setup Response message in step 10 and\n    the PDN Connectivity Complete message in step\u00a012, the MME sends a\n    Modify Bearer Request (EPS Bearer Identity, eNodeB address, eNodeB\n    TEID, Handover Indication, Presence Reporting Area Information) message\n    to the Serving GW. If the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation applies\n    and the PDN connection is not served via a SCEF type of connectivity,\n    steps 13 and 14 are executed only if the MME needs to report a change\n    of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, otherwise, if the PDN\n    connection is served by SCEF, steps 13,14, 15, and 16 are not executed.\n    If Request Type indicates \"handover\", the Handover Indication is also\n    included. If the MME has been requested to report a change of UE\n    presence in Presence Reporting Area, the MME includes in this message\n    the Presence Reporting Area Information comprising the PRA\n    identifier(s) and indication(s) on whether the UE is inside or outside\n    the area(s). When receiving the request for reporting change of UE\n    presence in Presence Reporting Area, and the MME decides not to\n    activate reporting UE presence in one or more of the received Presence\n    Reporting Area(s), the MME reports also the inactive Presence Reporting\n    Area(s) in this message.\n\n  13a. If the Handover Indication is included in step\u00a013, the Serving GW\n    sends a Modify Bearer Request (Handover Indication) message to the PDN\n    GW to prompt the PDN GW to tunnel packets from non 3GPP IP access to\n    3GPP access system and immediately start routing packets to the Serving\n    GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established. If\n    Presence Reporting Area Information is included in step\u00a013, the Serving\n    GW sends a Modify Bearer Request (Presence Reporting Area Information)\n    message to the PDN GW.\n\n  NOTE\u00a08:  The PDN GW forwards the Presence Reporting Area Information to\n         the PCRF, to the OCS or to both as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  13b. The PDN GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response to the\n    Serving GW.\n\n  14.  The Serving GW acknowledges by sending Modify Bearer Response (EPS\n    Bearer Identity) to the MME. The Serving GW can then send its buffered\n    downlink packets.\n\n  15.  After the MME receives Modify Bearer Response in step 14, if Request\n    type does not indicate handover and an EPS bearer was established and\n    if the subscription data indicates that the user is allowed to perform\n    handover to non-3GPP accesses and if this is the first PDN connection\n    associated with this APN and if the MME selected a PDN GW that is\n    different from the PDN GW identity which was previously indicated by\n    the HSS in the PDN subscription context, the MME shall send a Notify\n    Request including the PDN GW address and the APN to the HSS for\n    mobility with non-3GPP accesses. The message shall include information\n    that identifies the PLMN in which the PDN\u00a0GW is located.\n\n     For an unauthenticated or roaming UE, if the Request Type of the UE\n    requested connectivity procedure indicates \"Emergency\", the MME shall\n    not send any Notify Request to the HSS. For a non-roaming authenticated\n    UE, based on operator configuration (e.g. on whether Voice over WLAN is\n    supported or not by the operator), if the Request Type indicates\n    \"Emergency\", the MME may send a Notify Request to the HSS including the\n    \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\", which comprises the\n    PDN GW address and an indication that the PDN connection is for\n    emergency services. The HSS shall store it as part of the UE context\n    for emergency services.\n\n  16.  In the case of non-emergency services, the HSS stores the PDN GW\n    identity and the associated APN. In the case of emergency services, the\n    HSS stores the \"PDN GW currently in use for emergency services\". Then\n    the HSS sends a Notify Response to the MME.\n\n  NOTE\u00a09:  For handover from non-3GPP access, the PDN GW initiates resource\n         allocation deactivation procedure in the trusted/untrusted non-3GPP\n         IP access as specified in TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2].\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UE or MME requested PDN disconnection", "numbering": "5.10.3", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.10.3 UE or MME requested PDN disconnection\n\nThe UE or MME requested PDN disconnection procedure for an E-UTRAN is\ndepicted in figure 5.10.3-1. The procedure allows the UE to request for\ndisconnection from one PDN. Bearers including the default bearer of this\nPDN shall be deleted during this procedure. The procedure also allows the\nMME to initiate the release of a PDN connection.\n\nThis procedure is also used as part of the SIPTO function when the MME\ndetermines that GW relocation is desirable. In this situation the MME\ndeactivates the PDN connection(s) relevant to SIPTO-allowed APN(s) using\nthe \"reactivation requested\" cause value, and the UE should then re-\nestablish those PDN connection(s).\n\n  NOTE\u00a01:  The deactivation with reactivation requested does not work with\n         pre-Rel-9 LTE UEs.\n\nIt shall be possible to configure the MME to deactivate a PDN connection,\nfor PDN GW relocation due to SIPTO above RAN, only when UE is in ECM-IDLE\nmode or during a Tracking Area Update procedure without established RAB(s).\n\nThis procedure is not used to terminate the last PDN connection unless\n\"Attach without PDN Connectivity is supported\" in the Preferred Network\nbehaviour indicated by the UE at attach time is supported by the network\nand the UE at any time it requires the last PDN connection to be\ndisconnected. The UE uses the UE-initiated Detach procedure in\nclause\u00a05.3.8.2 to disconnect the last PDN connection. The MME uses the MME-\ninitiated Detach procedure in clause\u00a05.3.8.3 to release the last PDN\nconnection.\n\n                                    [pic]\n\n           Figure 5.10.3-1: UE or MME requested PDN disconnection\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  For a PMIP-based S5/S8, procedure steps (A) are defined in\n         TS\u00a023.402\u00a0[2]. Steps\u00a03, 4 and 5 concern GTP based S5/S8.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If after step\u00a06, the MME determines that PDN being disconnected\n         has no active bearers in the E-UTRAN, (e.g. because data is\n         transported using Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation) steps 7, 8.\n         10a and 10b are modified to only transfer the indicated ESM\n         signalling messages and steps 9a and 9b are skipped.\n\n  1. The procedure is triggered by either step\u00a01a or step\u00a01b.\n\n    1a.  The UE initiates the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure by\n       the transmission of a PDN Disconnection Request (LBI) message. The\n       LBI indicates the default bearer associated with the PDN connection\n       being disconnected. If the UE was in ECM-IDLE mode, this NAS message\n       is preceded by the Service Request procedure if any of the exiting\n       PDN connections were using the User Plane without CIoT EPS\n       Optimisation, or, if the user plane was used just with User Plane\n       CIoT EPS Optimisations, a Resume Procedure is executed instead.\n\n    1b.  The MME decides to release the PDN connection. This may be e.g.\n       due to change of subscription, lack of resources, due to SIPTO in\n       case the PDN connection serves a SIPTO-allowed APN or on receiving a\n       PDN GW Restart Notification from the Serving GW as specified in\n       TS\u00a023.007\u00a0[72]. If the UE is in ECM-IDLE state and the reason for\n       releasing PDN connection is \"reactivation requested\" e.g. due to\n       SIPTO, the MME initiates paging via Network Triggered Service Request\n       procedure in clause\u00a05.3.4.3 from step\u00a03a onwards in order to inform\n       UE of the request.\n\n  2. If the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the MME\n    shall perform step\u00a07 through 10 before step\u00a02 onwards. If the PDN\n    connection was served by a P-GW, the EPS Bearers in the Serving GW for\n    the particular PDN connection are deactivated by the MME by sending\n    Delete Session Request (Cause, LBI, User Location Information (ECGI),\n    Secondary RAT usage data) to the Serving GW. This message indicates\n    that all bearers belonging to that PDN connection shall be released. If\n    the UE Time Zone has changed, the MME includes the UE Time Zone IE in\n    this message. For PDN connection to the SCEF the MME indicates to the\n    SCEF the connection for the UE is no longer available according to\n    TS\u00a023.682\u00a0[74] and steps 2,3,4,5,6 are not executed. If the MME\n    received Secondary RAT usage data in step\u00a09b, the MME shall include it\n    in this Delete Session Request message.\n\n  3. The Serving GW sends Delete Session Request (Cause, LBI, User Location\n    Information (ECGI), Secondary RAT usage data) to the PDN GW. The S-GW\n    also includes User Location Information IE and/or UE Time Zone IE if it\n    is present in step\u00a02. The Serving GW also includes the Secondary RAT\n    usage data in this message if it was present in step\u00a02 and if PDN GW\n    secondary RAT usage data reporting is active.\n\n  4. The PDN GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (optionally, APN\n    Rate Control Status).\n\n  5. The PDN GW employs the PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Termination\n    procedure as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6] to indicate to the PCRF that the\n    IP-CAN session is released if PCRF is applied in the network. If\n    requested the PDN\u00a0GW indicates User Location Information and/or UE Time\n    Zone Information to the PCRF as defined in TS\u00a023.203\u00a0[6].\n\n  6. The Serving GW acknowledges with Delete Session Response (optionally,\n    APN Rate Control Status).\n\n     If received, the MME stores the APN Rate Control Status in the MM\n    context.\n\n  7. If the UE is in ECM IDLE state and the PDN disconnection is decided by\n    the MME, the MME shall delete the corresponding contexts of the PDN\n    connection locally, steps\u00a07 to 10b are skipped except if the MME has\n    decided to restore certain PDN connections as specified in\n    TS\u00a023.007\u00a0[72] or for other reasons e.g. SIPTO. The MME initiates the\n    deactivation of all Radio Bearers associated with the PDN connection to\n    the eNodeB by sending the Deactivate Bearer Request message to the\n    eNodeB. The MME shall re-calculate the UE-AMBR (see clause\u00a04.7.3).

The MME includes a flag that the Serving GW\n    shall not process this information and forward it to the PDN GW.\n\n  6. When the timer has expired after step\u00a04, the MME releases the\n    bearer(s) in the old Serving GW by sending a Delete Session Request\n    message (Cause, Operation Indication, Secondary RAT usage data).

This triggers the E-\nUTRAN to request the UE Radio Capability from the UE and to upload it to\nthe MME in the S1 interface UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message. The size\nof the UE Radio Capability information may be greater than can be carried\nin single RRC message but less than the maximum size of messages on the S1\ninterface. In this case, to obtain the information that it needs the RAN\nshould send multiple requests to the UE for different sub-sets of UE Radio\nCapability information (e.g. one request per RAT). Then the RAN shall\ncombine these subsets (excluding UTRAN and NB-IoT capabilities) into a\nsingle UE Radio Capability IE and upload it to the MME in the S1 interface\nUE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message.\n\nThe MME stores the UE Radio Capability information, and include it in\nfurther INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE RADIO CAPABILITY MATCH REQUEST\nmessages in other cases than Attach procedure, Tracking Area Update\nprocedure for the \"first TAU following GERAN/UTRAN Attach\" and \"UE radio\ncapability update\" procedure.\n\nIf the UE is performing a Service Request (or other) procedure and the MME\ndoes not have UE Radio Capability information available (or it is\navailable, but marked as \"deleted\"), then the MME sends an S1 interface\nINITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the E-UTRAN without any UE Radio\nCapability information in it. This triggers the E-UTRAN to request the UE\nRadio Capability from the UE and upload it to the MME in the S1 interface\nUE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message.\n\n  NOTE\u00a02:  This use of the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message means that\n         for a signalling only procedure such as a periodic Tracking Area\n         Update, the UE Radio Capability would not be sent to the E-UTRAN.\n\n  NOTE\u00a03:  If a \"first TAU following GERAN/UTRAN Attach\" Tracking Area\n         Update is performed during ECM-CONNECTED mode, e.g. after an inter\n         RAT handover, no INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST is sent and the UE\n         Radio Capability information in the MME will remain deleted until\n         the next ECM-IDLE to ECM-CONNECTED transition (or later, e.g. if\n         the next activity from the UE is another Tracking Area Update).\n\nWhen the CIoT EPS Optimisations do not apply, if the MME has not stored the\nUE Radio Capability information, in order to obtain UE radio capability for\npaging information, the MME can trigger the retrieval of the UE Radio\nCapability information by indicating UE Radio Capability request in\nDOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message during Attach or TAU procedure.\n\nFor the CIoT EPS Optimisations, during the Attach procedure or the Tracking\nArea Update procedure, e.g. for the \"first TAU following GERAN/UTRAN\nAttach\", if the MME does not send an S1 interface INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP\nREQUEST to the E-UTRAN, the MME should obtain the UE Radio Capability\ninformation by sending either the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message indicating\nUE Radio Capability request or the CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION\nmessage without UE Radio Capability information included to the E-UTRAN.\nThis triggers the E-UTRAN to request the UE Radio Capability from the UE\nand upload it to the MME in the S1 interface UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION\nmessage, as specified in TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[5]. In subsequent ECM connections, if\nthe MME does not send an S1 interface INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST to the\nE-UTRAN, the MME sends the UE Radio Capability to the E-UTRAN in the\nCONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message or DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT\nmessage.\n\nThe UE Radio Capability is not provided directly from one CN node to\nanother. It will be uploaded to the MME when the E-UTRAN requests the UE\nRadio Capability information from the UE.\n\nDuring handover via the MME (both intra RAT and inter RAT), the radio\ncapability information for the source and target 3GPP RATs (with the\npossible exception of UTRAN and E-UTRAN) are transferred in the \"source to\ntarget transparent container\". Information on additional 3GPP RATs is\noptionally transferred in the \"source to target transparent container\".\n\nAt handover, transfer of the radio capability information related to the\nsource and/or additional RATs is beneficial as it avoids the need for the\ntarget RAT to retrieve the information from the UE prior to a subsequent\ninter-RAT handover. However, there may be situations where the size of the\nUE Radio Capability may be too large for the information on all of the UE's\nRATs to be carried in a single message on one or more of the network\ninterfaces involved in the handover. Hence, the source RAN shall ensure\nthat the size of the UE Radio Capability information does not cause the\nsize of the \"source to target transparent container\" to exceed the limits\nthat can be handled by interfaces involved in the handover (e.g. Iu\ninterface (TS\u00a025.413\u00a0[22]) and, following SRVCC, E interface\n(TS\u00a029.002\u00a0[86])). This may result in some radio capability information\nbeing omitted from the \"source to target transparent container\" at inter-\nRAT handover. In this situation, the UE might be subject to an inter-RAT\nhandover to E-UTRAN via the MME which has the context stored for that UE,\nand, the MME may detect that the \"source to target transparent container\"\nis smaller than the UE Radio Capability stored in that UE's context. The\nMME may then add the full UE Radio Capability as a standalone Information\nElement in the S1-AP Handover Request message. As an implementation option,\nthe eNB may use this MME supplied information to avoid retrieving any\nmissing UE Radio Capability Information from the UE.\n\nIn the case that a source RAN node omits some radio capability information\nfrom the \"source to target transparent container\" at handover, the source\nRAN node shall ensure that any future target RAN node can detect that that\nradio capability information has been omitted.\n\nOwing to issues with dynamic UTRAN security parameters, special rules apply\nto the handling of the UTRAN radio capability information at inter-RAT\nhandover (see e.g. the HandoverPreparationInformation message description\nin TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[37] and the usage of the PS Handover Complete Ack message in\nTS\u00a043.129\u00a0[8] and TS\u00a048.018\u00a0[42])\n\nTo allow for the addition of future radio technologies, frequency bands,\nand other enhancements, the MME shall store the UE Radio Capability\nInformation as defined in TS\u00a023.008\u00a0[28].\n\nThe E-UTRAN stores the UE Radio Capability information, received in the S1\ninterface INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message or obtained from the UE,\nfor the duration of the RRC connection for that UE. Before any handover\nattempt from E-UTRAN to UTRAN, the E-UTRAN retrieves the UE's UTRAN Radio\nCapabilities from the UE.\n\nIf the UE's non-UTRAN UE Radio Capability information changes while in ECM-\nIDLE state (including cases of being in GERAN/UTRAN coverage), the UE shall\nperform a Tracking Area Update indicating \"UE radio capability update\" when\nit next returns to E-UTRAN coverage. When the UE is in ECM-IDLE with AS\ninformation stored (as defined in clause\u00a04.11 for User Plane CIOT EPS\noptimisation), NAS shall trigger AS to establish a new RRC connection and\nnot resume the existing one in order to send Tracking Area Update\nindicating \"UE radio capability update\". As a result of this, the access\nstratum in the UE will discard the AS information and establish a new RRC\nconnection as defined in TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[37].\n\nThe MME may also request for Voice Support Match Information. If requested,\nthe eNB then derives and provides an indication to the MME whether the UE\nradio capabilities are compatible with the network configuration (e.g.\nwhether the UE supports the frequency bands that the network may rely upon\nfor providing \"full\" PS voice coverage or whether the UE supports the SRVCC\nconfiguration of the network e.g. E-UTRAN to GERAN) as defined in\nclause\u00a05.3.14.\n\nThe Signalling of the UE Radio Access Capabilities can be optimised by\nmeans of the RACS feature defined in clause\u00a05.11.3a.\n\n\n", "Keywords": "LTE, GSM, UMTS, GPRS, architecture, stage 2"}, {"key": "UE Core Network Capability", "numbering": "5.11.3", "title_level": 2, "desc": "5.11.3 UE Core Network Capability\n\nThe UE Core Network Capability is split into the UE Network Capability IE\n(mostly for E-UTRAN access related core network parameters) and the MS\nNetwork Capability IE (mostly for UTRAN/GERAN access related core network\nparameters) and contains non radio-related capabilities, e.g. the NAS\nsecurity algorithms etc. Both the UE Network Capability and the MS Network\nCapability are transferred between CN nodes at MME to MME, MME to SGSN,\nSGSN to SGSN, and SGSN to MME changes.\n\nIn order to ensure that the UE Core Network Capability information stored\nin the MME is up to date (e.g. to handle the situation when the USIM is\nmoved into a different device while out of coverage, and the old device did\nnot send the Detach message; and the cases of inter-RAT Tracking Area\nUpdate), the UE shall send the UE Core Network Capability information to\nthe MME during the Attach and non-periodic Tracking Area Update procedure\nwithin the NAS message.\n\nThe MME shall store always the latest UE Core Network Capability received\nfrom the UE.

This identifier is called UE Radio Capability ID. A UE Radio\nCapability ID can be either Manufacturer-assigned or PLMN-assigned, as\nspecified in clause\u00a05.2.7. The UE Radio Capability ID is an alternative to\nthe signalling of the radio capabilities container over the radio\ninterface, within E-UTRAN, from E-UTRAN to NG-RAN, from MME to E-UTRAN and\nbetween CN nodes supporting RACS.\n\nThe UCMF (UE radio Capability Management Function) stores all UE Radio\nCapability ID mappings in a PLMN and is responsible for assigning every\nPLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in this PLMN, see clause\u00a04.4.13.\n\nIn order to be able to interpret the UE Radio Capability ID a network\nentity or node may store a local copy of the mapping between the UE Radio\nCapability ID and its corresponding UE Radio Access Capabilities\ninformation i.e. a dictionary entry.
