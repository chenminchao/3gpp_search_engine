         Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within
the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify
the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG
with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version
number as follows:

  Version x.y.z

  where:

    x  the first digit:

       1  presented to TSG for information;

       2  presented to TSG for approval;

       3  or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

    y  the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
       technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

    z  the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
       incorporated in the document.



         1  Scope

The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications (TSs)
that specify charging functionality and charging management in 3GPP
networks (GSM/UMTS/EPS). The 3GPP core network charging architecture and
principles are specified in document TS 32.240 [1], which provides an
umbrella for other charging management documents that specify:

  - the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);

  - the content of real-time charging events per domain/subsystem (online
    charging);

  - the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains and
    subsystems;

  - the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
    charging information
    (i.e. CDRs or charging events).

The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240 [1].

The present document specifies the CDR parameters, the abstract syntax and
encoding rules for all the CDR types that are defined in the charging
management TSs described above. Therefore, it is only applicable to offline
charging. The mechanisms used to transfer the CDRs from the generating node
to the operator's Billing Domain (e.g. the billing system or a mediation
device) are specified in TS 32.297 [52]. Further details with respect to
the operator's Billing Domain for offline charging are out of scope of 3GPP
standardisation.

Note that a generic Diameter application for online charging in 3GPP
networks is specified in TS 32.299 [50]. Furthermore, 3GPP TSs are being
created to standardise some technical aspects of the operator's Billing
Domain for online charging, i.e. the Online Charging System (OCS).

All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document, that
are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR
21.905 [100]. Those that are common across charging management in 3GPP
domains or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 [1]
and are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading.
Finally, those items that are specific to the present document are defined
exclusively in the present document.

Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in TS
22.115 [101].

3  Definitions, symbols and abbreviations


3.1  Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given
in TR 21.905 [100], TS 32.240 [1] and TS 32.297 [42] as well as the
following apply:

Billing Domain: part of the operator network, which is outside the core
network, which receives and processes CDR files from the core network
charging functions. It includes functions that can provide billing
mediation and billing or other (e.g. statistical) end applications. It is
only applicable to offline charging (see "Online Charging System" for
equivalent functionality in online charging).

Charging Data Record (CDR): formatted collection of information about a
chargeable event (e.g. time of call set-up, duration of the call, amount of
data transferred, etc) for use in billing and accounting. For each party to
be charged for parts of or all charges of a chargeable event a separate CDR
is generated, i.e. more than one CDR may be generated for a single
chargeable event, e.g. because of its long duration, or because more than
one charged party is to be charged.

offline charging: charging mechanism where charging information does not
affect, in real-time, the service rendered.

online charging: charging mechanism where charging information can affect,
in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct interaction of
the charging mechanism with bearer/session/service control is required.


3.2  Symbols

For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols as
specified in TR 21.905 [100], TS 32.240 [1],
TS 32.297 [52], TS 23.060 [202] and the following apply:

  Bx The Interface between a Charging Gateway Function (CGF) and the
             Billing Domain (BD)
  Ga Interface between a node transmitting CDRs (i.e. CDF) and a CDR
             receiving functionality (CGF)
  Gn Interface between two GSNs within the same PLMN.
  Gp Interface between two GSNs in different PLMNs. The Gp interface allows
             support of GPRS network services across areas served by the co-
             operating GPRS PLMNs.
  Rf Offline Charging Reference Point between a Charging Trigger Function
             (CTF) and the Charging Data Function (CDF)

i.e. the CDR files.

CDF and CGF may or may not be integrated with each others, the core network
or service nodes, or the BD.
The possibilities for integration or distribution of these functions are
described for each domain, subsystem or service in the respective
domain/subsystem/service specific charging TS.  In the distributed case,
the 3GPP standardized reference points/interfaces depicted above, shall be
used.

Refer to TS 32.240 [1] for a complete description of the charging
architecture.
Refer to TS 32.297 [52] for the description of the CGF's file based
interface to the BD.



         5  CDR parameters and abstract syntax


5.0  General

This clause specifies the parameters and the abstract syntax of the CDRs
defined for 3GPP charging management in references TS 32.250 [10] to TS
32.275 [35]. In doing this, the ASN.1 specified by X.680 [300] is utilized
as the notational tool.

This clause is organised in two parts:

  -  the first part describes the CDR parameters;

  -  the second part specifies the abstract syntax of the CDRs as seen in
    the CDR files transferred across the Bx interface.

Each part is further subdivided into a number of subclauses that contain
generic, bearer level, service level, and subsystem level CDR parameters
and abstract syntax definitions. Word processing features, such as
formatting options, have also been used to enhance human readability.

The complete set of all CDR syntax definitions is replicated in annex A in
a machine processable format. Technically, the contents of this clause and
annex A are completely identical. In case of deviations between this clause
and annex A due to errors in the present document, the annex shall prevail.

Note that the encoding rules for the abstract syntax specified in this
clause, are detailed in clause 6.


5.1  CDR parameter description

  Editor's note:  this subclause needs to be aligned with clause 5.2
         concerning the allocation of parameters to the domains versus
         making them generic.


5.1.1  Generic CDR parameters


5.1.1.0  Introduction

This subclause contains the description of generic CDR parameters, where
the term "generic" implies that these parameters are applicable to CDR
types of more than one domain/service/subsystem.


5.1.1.1.0A  3GPP PS Data Off Status

This field holds the Status of UE’s 3GPP PS Data Off.


5.1.1.1.0B  Data volume octets

This field includes the number of octet transmitted during the use of data
services.


5.1.1.1  Serving Network Identity

This field contains a SGSN PLMN Identifier (Mobile Country Code and Mobile
Network Code), of the SGSN that was used during the Location request. In
case the SGSN changes during the transaction, only the ID of the SGSN that
was used at the beginning of the transaction is included in the CDR.

The MCC and MNC are coded as described for 'Routing Area Identity' in
TS 29.060 [215].


5.1.1.2  Service Context Id

This field contains the Service Context Id from Diameter Accounting, if
Diameter Accounting was used and the field included. It identifies the
service, sub-system or domain and release that the CDR is applicable to.
The contents are described in TS 32.299 [50].


5.1.1.3  Subscription Identifier

This field identifies the charged party . The contents are coded in a
similar fashion as for the Subscription-Id AVP in TS 32.299 [50].


5.1.1.4  Service Specific Info

This grouped field holds the sub-fields "service specific data" and
"service specific type" if and as provided by an Application Server or PCEF
only for pre-defined PCC rules or TDF only for pre-defined ADC rules.


5.1.1.5  Service Specific Type

This field holds the type of the Service Specific Data parameter.


5.1.1.6  Service Specific Data

This field contains the value of service specific data.


5.1.1.7  Subscriber Equipment Number

The Subscriber Equipment Number field contains the identification of the
mobile device  that the subscriber is using.


5.1.2  Bearer level CDR parameters


5.1.2.0  General

This clause contains the description of the CDR parameters that are
specific to the bearer level CDR types.
This comprizes the CDR types from the Circuit Switched (CS) domain (TS
32.250 [10]), the Packet Switched (PS) domain, i.e. GPRS (TS 32.251 [11]).


5.1.2.1  CS domain CDR parameters


5.1.2.1.0   Introduction

This clause contains the description of the CDR parameters that are
specific to the CS domain CDR types as specified in TS 32.250 [10].


5.1.2.1.1   Additional Charging Information

This field consists of two parts, a charge indicator and additional
charging parameters. The charge indicator is derived from the information
contained within the ISUP "backward call indicator" and may be used to
store a charge indicator (charge/no charge) received from another network
node. The additional charging parameters are non-standard and intended to
permit the inclusion of further charging information received from
Intelligent Network and/or Value Added Service nodes.


5.1.2.1.2   AoC parameters/change of AoC parameters

The AoC parameter field contains the set of charge advice (AoC) parameters
sent to the MS on call set-up. If further sets of parameters are sent
during the call, as a result of a tariff switch-over for example, then this
may be recorded in the Change of AoC Parameter field including the time at
which the change occurred.

It should be noted that the Change of AoC Parms. field is optional and not
required if partial records are generated on tariff switch-over.

The AoC parameters are defined in TS 22.024 [104].


5.1.2.1.3   Basic Service/change of service/ISDN Basic Service

The basic service field contains the code of the basic service employed on
call set-up. Any alteration to the basic service during the connection may
be recorded in the change of service field including the time at which the
change took place.

The change of service field is optional and may be omitted if partial
records are created whenever the basic service is changed.

The coding of basic services is defined in detail in TS 29.002 [214].

In the case of the transit record the GSM basic service employed is
generally not available. However, if the device on which the call
originates/terminates is connected via ISDN digital subscriber signalling
then the appropriate ISDN basic service code may be recorded in the record.
One possible example includes the direct connection of an ISDN PABX to an
MSC/VLR.


5.1.2.1.4   Call duration

This field contains the relevant call duration in seconds. For incomplete
calls (call attempts) the relevant duration is the call holding time from
the seizure to the release of the traffic channel. For complete (answered)
calls this is the chargeable duration from answer to release of the traffic
channel. For partial records this is the duration of the individual partial
record and not the cumulative duration of the call.

It should be noted that the time stamps may be expressed in terms of tenths
of seconds or even milliseconds and, as a result, the calculation of the
call duration may result in the rounding or truncation of the measured
duration to a whole number of seconds.

Whether or not rounding or truncation is to be used is considered to be
outside the scope of the present document subject to the following
restrictions:

  1) A call duration of zero seconds shall not be accepted.

  2) The same method of truncation/rounding shall be applied to both single
    and partial records.

If CAMEL is invoked for the call and a control relationship is existing,
the call might continue after a RELEASE or a DISCONNECT from the called
party side received by the gsmSSF. The call duration of the incoming leg is
stored in the main body of the call record. For each outgoing leg the call
duration is stored in the respective 'CAMELInformation' module. If a call
leg does not reach answer status and attempt charging is enabled a
'CAMELInformation' module containing the holding time is generated.

An example of how to use the call duration and the timestamps is given in
figure 5.1.2.1.4.1. It shows a CAMEL controlled mobile originated follow-on
scenario. The uppermost arrow ( marks the over all duration of the call
that is to be measured and stored in the main body of the respective MOC
record. The duration before t5 (incoming leg) or t4 (outgoing leg) needs
not to be stored since the call is answered later on. The call duration in
the first outgoing leg module contains the time interval from t4 to t6
(period (). The call duration measurement of the second outleg is started
with t9 and ended with t10 (interval ().

Since the last outgoing leg is not answered, the respective module contains
the holding time starting with t11 and ending with t13 (period ().

(The timestamps t1, t2, t3, t7, t8 and t12 are mentioned for completion
reasons only.)

             5.1.2.1.5   Call reference

This field uniquely identifies a call or transaction on one side of the
interface (i.e. 'A' or 'B' side) and is derived from the transaction
identifier of TS 24.008 [208]. It is also used to identify all partial
records and transactions belonging to the same connection.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no global call reference defined
within GSM and the call reference field cannot be used to combine, for
example, the MOC and MTC records of a mobile-to-mobile connection.


5.1.2.1.6   Calling/called/connected/translated number

In general an Recommendation E.164 [308] number but may also include other
numbering plans e.g. ITU-T Recommendation X.121 [315]. Each of these fields
includes the type of number and number plan as specified in detail in
TS 24.008 [208]. Where appropriate, these fields may also contain the
presentation and screening information also specified in TS 24.008 [208].

The called number is the number received from the mobile station on mobile
originated call set-up as defined in TS 24.008 [208]. Similarly, the
calling number is the number received from the network on mobile terminated
call set-up. In case of CAMEL initiated Call Forward (CF), the called
(forwarded-to) number is returned by CAMEL.

The translated number is the result of any digit translation performed by
the MSC on the called number received from the mobile station on mobile
originated call set-up. This parameter is not included in the CDR if no
digit translation has taken place.

The connected number is the number of the actual party reached as defined
in TS 24.008 [208]. Although this is normally identical to the called
number it may differ. This parameter is not included if identical to the
called number.

The following examples are intended to explain the use of these fields:

  EXAMPLE 1:  Called Number = Connected Number

     Normal call from a mobile subscriber to a mobile subscriber or to a
             PSTN subscriber.

  EXAMPLE 2:  Called Number != Connected Number

     In case of routing to a PABX with Automatic Call Distribution or to an
             ISDN Basic Access with several devices attached. The connected
             number is that of the party actually reached. N.B. The
             recording of the actual number connected may be limited by the
             capability of intermediate signalling connections.

  EXAMPLE 3:  MTC record for Call Forwarding ("A" -> "B" -> "C")

     In case of call forwarding, the connected number recorded in the MTC
             record of the "B" subscriber is that of the forwarded-to party
             or "C" subscriber. The calling party field contains the number
             of the "A" subscriber.

  EXAMPLE 4:  Translated Number

     This field is only present if digit translation is applied by the MSC
             to the called number received from the mobile station.
             Examples include abbreviated dialling codes and service
             numbers.


5.1.2.1.7   Calling Party Number

This field contains Calling Party Number modified by CAMEL service.


5.1.2.1.8   CAMEL call leg information

This field contains a set of CAMEL information IEs according to the number
of outgoing CAMEL call legs.



             5.1.2.1.9   CAMEL information

This field contains a list of parameters with information related to one
CAMEL outgoing call leg. This parameter list is an Information Element (IE)
used in the CAMEL Call Leg Information field.

As a network option, parameters that are identical to the corresponding
values in the top level structure of the record are not recorded again.
That means whenever a value is not mentioned in this set the value provided
in the basic record is valid instead. This might lead to an empty or even
absent structure, if no parameter was modified.


5.1.2.1.10  CAMEL initiated CF indicator

The purpose of this field is to distinguish CAMEL call forwarding service
scenarios from standard GSM call forwarding scenarios.

From the Basic Call State Model (BCSM)'s point of view this field is set to
'CF' whenever the Originating CAMEL Subscription Information (O_CSI) was
applied after terminating CAMEL call processing had been taken place
changing the call destination. For the avoidance of doubt: this flag does
not depend on other modified call parameter(s) (e.g.: redirection
information, etc.) received in the CAP_CONNECT message of the Terminating
CAMEL Subscription Information (T_CSI) service.

This flag also indicates that another record might be generated, one
containing the charging information related to the terminating CAMEL
service and one containing the charging information related to the
originating CAMEL service.


5.1.2.1.11  CAMEL modified Service Centre

This field contains SMS-C address modified by CAMEL service. If this field
is present the field Service Centre contain SMS-C address before CAMEL
modification.


5.1.2.1.12  CAMEL SMS Information

This field contains following CAMEL information for mobile originated and
terminated SMS:

  -  Default SMS handling:

     This field indicates whether or not a CAMEL encounters default SMS
       handling. This field shall be present only if default SMS handling
       has been applied.

  -  Free format data:

     See clause 5.1.2.1.26.

  -  Calling Party Number:

     This field contains Calling Party Number modified by CAMEL service.

  -  CAMEL modified Service Centre:

     This field contains SMS-C address modified by CAMEL service.

  NOTE 1:  This field is only applicable for originated SMS.

  -  CAMEL Destination Subscriber Number

     This field contains short message Destination Number modified by CAMEL
       service.

  NOTE 2:  This field is only applicable for originated SMS.

  -  SMS Reference Number:

     This field contains the SMS Reference Number assigned to the Short
       Message by the MSC.



             5.1.2.1.13  Cause for termination

This field contains a generalised reason for the release of the connection
including the following:

  -  normal release;

  -  CAMEL initiated call release;

  -  partial record generation;

  -  partial record call re-establishment;

  -  unsuccessful call attempt;

  -  abnormal termination during the stable phase;

  -  unauthorized network originating a location service request;

  -  unauthorized client requesting a location service;

  -  position method failure at a location service execution;

  -  unknown or unreachable LCS client at a location service request.

A more detailed reason may be found in the diagnostics field.


5.1.2.1.14  Channel Coding Accepted/Channel Coding Used

A list of traffic channel codings for HSCSD connections accepted/negotiated
by the MS.

These parameters are only present in the CDRs for HSCSD connections.


5.1.2.1.15  Data volume

This field includes the number of 64 octet segments transmitted during the
use of data services if known.


5.1.2.1.16  Default call/SMS handling

This field indicates whether or not a CAMEL encountered default call/SMS
handling. This field shall be present only if default call/SMS handling has
been applied. Parameter is defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription
information.


5.1.2.1.17  Destination Subscriber Number

This field contains Destination/Called Subscriber Number modified by CAMEL
service. If not modified then this field may contain original Destination
Number also when CAMEL is not active.


5.1.2.1.18  Diagnostics

This field includes a more detailed technical reason for the release of the
connection and may contain one of the following:

  -  a MAP error from TS 29.002 [214];

  -  a Cause from TS 24.008 [208];

  -  a Cause from TS 29.078 [217];

  -  a Cause from ITU-T Recommendation Q.767 [309];

  -  a LCS diagnostics according TS 29.002 [214].

The diagnostics may also be extended to include manufacturer and network
specific information.



             5.1.2.1.19  EMS-Digits

This parameter only applies to location for an emergency services call in
North America and gives the North American Emergency Services Routing
Digits as defined in TS 29.002 [214].


5.1.2.1.20  EMS-Key

This parameter only applies to location for an emergency services call in
North America and gives the North American Emergency Services Routing Key
as defined in TS 29.002 [214].


5.1.2.1.21  Entity number

This field contains the Recommendation E.164 [308] number assigned to the
entity (MSC, VLR, HLR etc.) that produced the record. For further details
concerning the structure of MSC and location register numbers see
TS 23.003 [200].


5.1.2.1.22  Equipment id

This field contains a local identifier used to distinguish between
equipment of the same equipment type e.g. the number of the conference
circuit employed if more than one is available.


5.1.2.1.23  Equipment type

This field contains the type of common equipment employed e.g. conference
circuit for multi-party service.


5.1.2.1.24  Event time stamps

These fields contain the event time stamps relevant for each of the
individual record types.

The call records may contain three significant call handling time stamps:

  -  the time at which the resource in question was seized  (Seizure time);

  -  the time at which the call was answered or at which charging commences
    (Answer time);

  -  the time at which the resource was released (Release time).

For both Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated calls, the Seizure time is
the time at which the traffic channel is allocated i.e. the time at which
the ASSIGN COMMAND message is sent to the MS.

For Mobile Originated calls the Answer time is the time at which the
CONNECT message is sent to the calling party. For Mobile Terminated calls
the time at which the CONNECT message is received from the called party.
However, if the subscriber has subscribed to the advice of charge charging
level service, then the answer time shall be derived from the time at which
the FACILITY message is received from the MS containing the acknowledgement
of receipt of the AOC parameters. Similarly, if the AOC parameters are
changed during the call then the change time recorded for a subscriber with
AOC charging level is the receipt of the FACILITY message from the MS. For
a subscriber with AOC information level the change time recorded is the
time at which the FACILITY is sent to the MS. Finally, in case of call re-
establishment the answer time is the time at which the new traffic channel
is allocated by the MSC i.e. when the ASSIGN COMMAND is sent to the MS.

The Release time is the time at which the connection is released by either
party i.e. a DISCONNECT or RELEASE is sent by the network or a DISCONNECT
is received from the MS. In the case of a radio link failure, the release
time is the time at which the failure was detected by the MSC.

For unsuccessful call attempts the Seizure time is mandatory. The Release
time is optional and the call duration recorded is the call holding time
i.e. the difference between the two.

For successful calls the Answer time is mandatory and both the Seizure and
Release times are optional. The call duration recorded is the chargeable
duration i.e. the difference between the Answer and Release time stamps.

The event records include the following time stamps:

  -  HLR-int time:  The receipt of a MAP_SEND_ROUTING_INFO request by the
    HLR;

  -  Loc.Upd. time: The receipt of a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION_AREA request by
    the VLR or the receipt of  a MAP_UPDATE_LOCATION request by the HLR;

  -  SS-Action: The receipt of a supplementary service request by the VLR;

     e.g. MAP_REGISTER_SS, MAP_INVOKE_SS

  -  SMS-MO:    The receipt of an RP_DATA message from the MS containing an
    SMS_SUBMIT PDU;

  -  SMS-MT:    The transmission of an RP_DATA message to the MS containing
    an SMS_DELIVER  PDU;

  -  LCS:  The time the LR was processed.

It should be noted that the events listed above are only examples in order
to demonstrate the principles and that the list is by no means exhaustive.

All time-stamps include a minimum of date, hour, minute and second.


5.1.2.1.25  Fixed Network User Rate

This field indicates the user data rate applied for the connection in the
fixed network. In UMTS, it shall be present for all bearer services as
specified in TS 22.002 [102]. In GSM, this parameter is part of the HSCSD
connection parameters, see clause 5.1.2.1. 30.


5.1.2.1.26  Free format data

This field contains charging information sent by the gsmSCF in the Furnish
Charging Information (FCI) messages as defined in TS 29.078 [217]. The data
can be sent either in one FCI message or several FCI messages with append
indicator. This data is transferred transparently in the CAMEL clauses of
the relevant call records. 'Free format data' sent to the legID=1 is always
stored in the top level of the respective record. 'Free format data' sent
to the legID >1 is stored in the appropriate CAMEL call leg information
field.

If the FCI is received more then once during one continuing
incoming/outgoing CAMEL call leg, the append indicator defines whether the
FCI information is appended to previous FCI and stored in the relevant
record or the information of the last FCI received is stored in the
relevant record (the previous FCI information shall be overwritten).

In the event of partial output the currently valid 'Free format data' is
stored in the partial record.


5.1.2.1.27  Free format data append indicator

This field contains an indicator whether free format data is to be appended
to free format data stored in previous partial CDR. This field is needed in
CDR post-processing to sort out valid free format data for that call leg
from sequence of partial records. Creation of partial records is
independent on received FCIs and thus valid free format data may be divided
to different partial records.

If field is missing then free format data in this CDR replaces all received
free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is not needed in the
first partial record. In following partial records indicator shall get
value true if all FCIs received during that partial record have append
indicator. If one or more of the received FCIs for that call leg during the
partial record do not have append indicator then this field shall be
missing.


5.1.2.1.28  GsmSCF address

This field identifies the CAMEL server serving the subscriber. Address is
defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.


5.1.2.1.29  Guaranteed Bit Rate

This field contains the Guaranteed Bit Rate based on the FNUR for
transparent and Wanted AIUR for non-transparent CS data services based on
the described mapping in TS 27.001 [213]. The Guaranteed Bit Rate may be
used to facilitate admission control based on available resources, and for
resource allocation within UMTS. The bit-rate of the UMTS bearer service
shall guarantee to the user or applications refer TS 22.002 [102].

Operator may choose any of the possible values less or equal to wanted AIUR
(Air Interface User Rate).
(If WAIUR is less or equal to 14,4 kbit/s then Guaranteed Bit Rate and
Maximum Bit Rate shall be set to 14,4 kbit/s).


5.1.2.1.30  HSCSD parameters/Change of HSCSD parameters

       defined in HLR as part of CAMEL subscription information.

  - Default Transaction/SMS Handling (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):

    This field indicates whether or not a CAMEL encountered default GPRS-
       or SMS-handling. This field shall be present only if default call
       handling has been applied. Parameter is defined in HLR as part of

  - Free Format Data (S-CDR, M-CDR, S-SMO-CDR, S-SMT-CDR):

    This field contains charging information sent by the gsmSCF in the
       Furnish Charging Information GPRS messages as defined
       in TS 29.078 [217]. The data can be sent either in one FCI message or
       several FCI messages with append indicator. This data is transferred
       transparently in the CAMEL clauses of the relevant call records.

    If the FCI is received more then once during one CAMEL call, the append
       indicator defines whether the FCI information is appended to previous
       FCI and stored in the relevant record or the information of the last
       FCI received is stored in the relevant record (the previous FCI

  - FFD Append Indicator (S-CDR, M-CDR):

    This field contains an indicator whether CAMEL free format data is to
       be appended to free format data stored in previous partial CDR. This
       field is needed in CDR post processing to sort out valid free format
       data for that call leg from sequence of partial records. Creation of
       partial records is independent of received FCIs and thus valid free
       format data may be divided to different partial records.

    If field is missing then free format data in this CDR replaces all
       received free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is not
       needed in the first partial record. In following partial records
       indicator shall get value true if all FCIs received during that
       partial record have append indicator. If one or more of the received
       FCIs for that call leg during the partial record do not have append
       indicator then this field shall be missing.

  - Level of CAMEL services (S-CDR, M-CDR):

5.1.2.2.7   Charging Characteristics

The Charging Characteristics field allows the operator to apply different
kind of charging methods in the CDRs.
A subscriber may have Charging Characteristics assigned to his
subscription. These characteristics can be supplied by the HLR/HSS
according to the rules specified in Annex A of TS 32.251 [11].

Charging Characteristics used by IP-Edge [PCEF] or TDF in Convergent Fixed-
Mobile Operator scenario are always configured in IP-Edge [PCEF] or TDF
respectively, as described in annex D of TS 32.251 [11].

This information can be used by the PCNs/ IP-Edge [PCEF] to activate
charging generation and e.g. control the closure of the CDR or the traffic
volume containers (see clause 5.1.2.2.25) and applied charging
characteristics is included in CDRs transmitted to nodes handling the CDRs
via the Ga reference point. It can also be used in nodes handling the CDRs
(e.g., the CGF or the billing system) to influence the CDR processing
priority and routing. These functions are accomplished by specifying the
charging characteristics as sets of charging profiles and the expected
behaviour associated with each profile.
The interpretations of the profiles and their associated behaviours can be
different for each PLMN operator and are not subject to standardisation. In
the present document only the charging characteristic formats and selection
modes are specified.

The functional requirements for the Charging Characteristics are further
defined in normative Annex A of
TS 32.251 [11], including an example for the definitions of the trigger
profiles associated with each CDR type.

The format of charging characteristics field is depicted in Figure 4. Each
Bx (x =0..15) refers to a specific behaviour defined on a per-Operator
basis, indicated as active when set to "1" value. See Annex A of
TS 32.251 [11] for guidance on how behaviours could be defined.

  -  APN specific;

  -  Subscription specific.

In the S-GW/P-GW/TDF the allowed values are:

  -  Home default;

  -  Visiting default;

  -  Roaming default;

  -  Serving node supplied.

  NOTE:  The value 'Serving Node Supplied' is used if the CC what was
         received from e.g. S-GW is used i.e. the one what comes during
         bearer activation.

Further details are provided in TS 32.251 [11] Annex A.

In the IP-Edge [PCEF] and TDF in Convergent Fixed-Mobile Operator scenario,
the allowed values are:

  -  Visiting default;

  -  Fixed default;

Further details are provided in TS 32.251 [11] Annex D.


5.1.2.2.9   Charging ID

This field is a charging identifier, which can be used together with P-GW
address to identify all records produced in SGSN(s), S-GW and P-GW involved
in a single IP-CAN bearer. Charging ID is generated by P-GW at IP-CAN
bearer activation and transferred to bearer requesting SGSN/S-GW. At inter-
SGSN/S-GW change the charging ID is transferred to the new SGSN/S-GW as
part of each active IP-CAN bearer.

In case of PMIP-based connectivity, the Charging Id is generated per PDN
connection.

Different P-GWs allocate the charging ID independently of each other and
may allocate the same numbers.
The CGF and/or BS may check the uniqueness of each charging ID together
with the P-GWs address and optionally (if still ambiguous) with the record
opening time stamp.

terms of tenths of seconds or even milliseconds and, as a result, the
calculation of the duration may result in the rounding or truncation of the
measured duration to a whole number of seconds.

Whether or not rounding or truncation is to be used is considered to be
outside the scope of the present document subject to the following
restrictions:

  1) A duration of zero seconds shall be accepted providing that the

  NOTE:  Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity are not
         used together with Service Identification reporting. Furthermore,
         neither the Sponsor Identity nor Application Service Provider
         Identity is applicable to the TDF.

  -  Related Change of Service Condition indicates the reason a related
    container was closed when the current container is indirectly closed
    and the supplemental information for the event. This information is
    applicable when charging per IP-CAN session is active for a multi-
    access PDN connection.

  -  Serving PLMN Rate Control This field contains the Serving PLMN Rate
    Control applied by MME during the transfer of the data volume captured
    by the container (applicable only to the PGW-CDR). This is included in
    the service data container only if previous container's change
    condition is "Serving PLMN Rate Control change ". Note the Serving PLMN
    Rate Control field in PGW-CDR main level contains the Serving PLMN Rate
    Control when PGW-CDR was opened.

  -  APN Rate Control This field contains the APN Rate Control applied by
    PGW during the transfer of the data volume captured by the container
    (applicable only to the PGW-CDR). This is included in the service data
    container only if previous container's change condition is "APN Rate
    Control change ". Note the APN Rate Control field in PGW-CDR main level
    contains the APN Rate Control when PGW-CDR was opened.

  -  Traffic Steering Policy Identifier Downlink This field contains the
    Traffic Steering Policy Identifier Downlink applied by PGW/ TDF during
    the service data container recording interval.

  -  Traffic Steering Policy Identifier Uplink This field contains the
    Traffic Steering Policy Identifier Uplink applied by PGW/TDF during the
    service data container recording interval.


5.1.2.2.25  List of Traffic Data Volumes

This list applicable in S-CDR, SGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR and TWAG-CDR,
includes one or more containers.

This list applicable in PGW-CDR when charging per IP-CAN session is active
and IP-CAN bearer charging is being performed for the session.

In SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR and TWAG-CDR, containers are per
QCI/ARP pair. This means that if QoS control within one IP-CAN bearer is
applicable in S-GW, P-GW, ePDG and TWAG, there can be several containers
open at same time one per each applied QCI/ARP pair.

Each container includes the following fields:

  -  Data Volume Uplink, Data Volume Downlink, Change Condition and Change
    Time.

  -  Data Volume Uplink includes the number of octets transmitted during
    the use of the packet data services in the uplink direction. In MBMS
    charging, this field is normally to be set to zero, because MBMS
    charging is based on the volume of the downlink data. The counting of
    uplink data volumes is optional. In S-CDR this field is not present
    when the SGSN has successfully established Direct Tunnel between the
    RNC and the GGSN.

  -  Data Volume Downlink includes the number of octets transmitted during
    the use of the packet data services in the downlink direction. In S-CDR
    this field is not present when the SGSN has successfully established
    Direct Tunnel between the RNC and the GGSN.

  -  Change Condition defines the reason for closing the container (see TS
    32.251 [11]), such as tariff time change, QoS change or closing of the
    CDR. This field is derived from Change-Condition AVP Traffic-Data-
    Volumes AVP level defined in TS 32.299 [40] when received on Rf. Each
    value is mapped to the corresponding value in "ChangeCondition" field.
    When no Change-Condition AVP is provided, the "recordClosure" value is
    set for the container. For User Location Change, when one of the
    "CGI/SAI, ECGI or TAI or RAI Change" are reported as user location
    change, the dedicated value in service Condition Change is set instead
    of the generic "user location change" value.

  -  Change Time is a time stamp, which defines the moment when the volume
    container is closed or the CDR is closed. All the active IP-CAN bearers
    do not need to have exactly the same time stamp e.g. due to same tariff
    time change (variance of the time stamps is implementation and traffic
    load dependent, and is out of the scope of standardisation).

  -  User Location Information contains the location (e.g. CGI/SAI,
    ECGI/TAI or RAI) where the UE is located and used during the transfer
    of the data volume captured by the container (applicable only to the
    SGW-CDR). This is included in the Traffic data container only if
    previous container's change condition is "user location change". Note
    the user location information in SGW-CDR main level contains the
    location where the UE was when SGW-CDR was opened, and the "Last user
    location information" in SGW-CDR main level contains the location where
    the UE was when SGW-CDR is closed.

  -  UWAN User Location Information contains the Untrusted Wireless Access
    Network (UWAN) user location during the transfer of the data volume
    captured by the container. This is included in the Traffic data
    container only if previous container's change condition is "user
    location change". Note the user location information in ePDG-CDR main
    level contains the location where the UE was when ePDG-CDR was opened.

  -  TWAN User Location Information contains the user location in a Trusted
    WLAN Access Network during the the transfer of the data volume captured
    by the container. This is included in the Traffic data container only
    if previous container’s change condition is "user location change".
    Note the user location information in TWAG-CDR main level contains the
    location where the UE was when TWAG-CDR was opened.

  -  Presence Reporting Area Status contains the status of the UE presence
    (i.e. indication on whether the UE is inside or outside) in the
    Presence Reporting Area(s) identified by "Presence Reporting Area
    identifier(s)" contained in SGW-CDR main level. This is included in the
    Traffic data container when the initial status is reported after
    opening of SGW-CDR, or if previous container’s change condition is
    "Presence in Presence Reporting Area Change". This field is not
    applicable in multiple PRA(s).

  -  List of Presence Reporting Area Information contains the list of
    Presence Reporting Area Information. Each Presence Reporting Area
    Information includes the "Presence Reporting Area identifier", the
    status of the UE presence (i.e. indication on whether the UE is inside
    or outside the Presence Reporting Area or Presence Reporting Area(s)
    inactive). In the PGW it contains the Node (PCRF, OCS) which subscribed-
    to the PRA.

  -  User CSG information contains the status of the user accessing a CSG
    cell (CSG ID within the PLMN, Access mode and indication on CSG
    membership) during the transfer of the data volume captured by the
    container. This is included in the Traffic data container only if
    previous container’s change condition is "user CSG information change".
    Note the "user CSG information" in S-CDR/SGW-CDR main level contains
    the "user CSG information" when S-CDR/SGW-CDR was opened.

  -  EPC QoS Information In case of IP-CAN bearer specific container this
    contains authorized QoS for the IP-CAN bearer. First container for each
    QCI/ARP pair includes this field. In following containers this field is
    present if previous change condition is "QoS change". This field is
    applicable only in SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR, and TWAG-CDR.

In S-CDR first container includes following optional fields: QoS Requested
and QoS Negotiated. In following containers QoS Negotiated is present if
previous change condition is "QoS change". In addition to the QoS
Negotiated parameter the QoS Requested parameter is present in following
containers if the change condition is "QoS change" and the QoS change was
initiated by the MS via a IP-CAN bearer modification procedure.

Table 5.1.2.2.25.1 illustrates an examplefor S-CDR but same principles are
applicable also for SGW-CDR, PGW-CDR, IPE-CDR, ePDG-CDR and TWAG-CDR. There
are five containers (sets of volume counts) caused by one QoS change, one
location change, one tariff time change and one Direct Tunnel establishment
(direct tunnel change applicable in S-CDR only). When CDR is opened the
subscriber is in CGI1.

First container includes initial QoS values and corresponding volume
counts. Second container includes new QoS values and corresponding volume
counts before tariff time change. Third container includes the indication
of location change and corresponding volume counts before the location
change and after the tariff time change. Fourth container includes volume
counts after the location change and contains the indication of Direct
Tunnel establishment. Last container includes no volume count as it refers
to Direct Tunnel establishment. The total volume counts can be itemised as
shown in Table 5.1.2.2.25.2 (tariff1 is used before and tariff2 after the
tariff time change):

The amount of data counted in the S-GW shall be the payload of the user
plane at the S1-U/S4/S2interface. Therefore the data counted already
includes the IP PDP bearer protocols i.e. IP or PPP.

The data volume counted in the SGSN is dependent on the system. For GSM
SGSN the data volume is the payload of the SNDCP PDUs at the Gb interface.
For UMTS-SGSN it is the GTP-U PDUs at the Iu-PS interface. Therefore, in
both systems, the data counted already includes the overheads of any PDP
bearer protocols.

In GSM, in order to avoid that downstream packets transmitted from the old
SGSN to the new SGSN at inter SGSN RA update induce the increase of the PDP
CDR downstream volume counters in both SGSN the following rules must be
followed:

  -  For PDP contexts using LLC in unacknowledged mode: an SGSN shall
    update the PDP CDR when the packet has been sent by the SGSN towards
    the MS;

     For PDP contexts using LLC in acknowledged mode, a GSM-SGSN shall only
    update the PDP CDR at the reception of the acknowledgement by the MS of
    the correct reception of a downstream packet. In other worlds, for
    inter SGSN RA update, the new SGSN shall update the PDP CDR record when
    a downstream packet sent by the old SGSN is received by the MS and
    acknowledged by the MS towards the new SGSN through the RA update
    complete message.

In UMTS, the not transferred downlink data can be accounted for in the S-
CDR with "RNC Unsent Downlink Volume" field, which is the data that the RNC
has either discarded or forwarded during handover. Data volumes
retransmitted (by RLC or LLC) due to poor radio link conditions shall not
be counted.

The following additional fields are applicable in the P-GW CDR when
charging per IP-CAN session is active and IP-CAN bearer charging is being
performed for the session:

5.1.2.2.45  PS Furnish Charging Information

This field includes following information elements for IP-CAN bearer (PGW-
CDR) , for TDF session (TDF-CDR) , or for the IP-CAN session (IPE-CDR):

  - PS Free Format Data



    This field contains charging information sent by the OCS in the
    Diameter Credit-Control Credit-Control-Answer messages as defined in
    TS 32.251 [11]. The data can be sent either in one Diameter Credit-
    Control Credit-Control-Answer message or several Diameter Credit-
    Control Credit-Control-Answer messages with append indicator. This data
    is transferred transparently in the PS Furnish Charging Information
    field of the relevant call records.

    If the PS Free Format Data is received more than once during one IP-CAN
    bearer for which an offline session is established, the append
    indicator defines whether the PS Free Format Data is appended to
    previous received PS Free Format Data and stored in the relevant record
    or the information of the last PS Free Format Data received is stored
    in the relevant record (the previous PS Free Format Data information
    shall be overwritten).

    In the event of partial output the currently valid "PS Free format
       data" is stored in the partial record.

  - PS FFD Append Indicator:



    This field contains an indicator whether PS free format data is to be
    appended to the PS free format data stored in previous partial CDR.
    This field is needed in CDR post processing to sort out valid PS free
    format data for that IP-CAN bearer from sequence of partial records.
    Creation of partial records is independent of received PS Free Format
    Data and thus valid PS  free format data may be divided to different
    partial records.

     If field is missing then the PS free format data in this CDR replaces
    all received PS free format data in previous CDRs. Append indicator is
    not needed in the first partial record. In following partial records
    indicator shall get value true if all PS Free Format Data received
    during that partial record have append indicator. If one or more of the
    received PS Free Format Data for that PDP Context during the partial
    record do not have append indicator then this field shall be missing.


5.1.2.2.46  QoS Requested/QoS Negotiated

Quality of Service Requested contains the QoS desired by MS at IP-CAN
bearer activation. QoS Negotiated indicates the applied QoS accepted by the
network.

If a pre-Release '99 only capable terminal is served, the applicable QoS

5.1.2.4.5   Charging Characteristics

The Charging Characteristics field allows the operator to apply different
kind of charging methods in the CDRs.
A subscriber may have Charging Characteristics assigned to his
subscription. These characteristics can be supplied by the HSS and selected
according to the rules specified in Annex X of TS 32.253 [13].

This information can be used by the CPCNs (SCEF, IWK-SCEF, MME) to activate
charging generation and e.g. control the closure of the CDR or the traffic
volume containers, and applied charging characteristics is included in CDRs
transmitted via the Ga/Rf reference point. It can also be used in nodes
handling the CDRs (e.g., the CGF or the billing system) to influence the
CDR processing priority and routing. These functions are accomplished by
specifying the charging characteristics as sets of charging profiles and
the expected behaviour associated with each profile.
The interpretations of the profiles and their associated behaviours can be
different for each PLMN operator and are not subject to standardisation. In
the present document only the charging characteristic formats and selection
modes are specified.

The format of charging characteristics field is depicted in Figure
5.1.2.4.5.1. Each Bx (x =0..15) refers to a specific behaviour defined on a
per-Operator basis, indicated as active when set to "1" value. See Annex X
of TS 32.253 [13]. for guidance on how behaviours could be defined.

connection establishment and transferred to IWK-SCEF/MME., The charging ID
is transferred to the new MME, at MME change during the lifetime of the PDN
connection.

Different SCEFs allocate the charging ID independently of each other and
may allocate the same numbers.
The CGF and/or BS may check the uniqueness of each charging ID together
with the SCEFs address and optionally (if still ambiguous) with the record
opening time stamp.

terms of tenths of seconds or even milliseconds and, as a result, the
calculation of the duration may result in the rounding or truncation of the
measured duration to a whole number of seconds.

Whether or not rounding or truncation is to be used is considered to be
outside the scope of the present document subject to the following
restrictions:

  1) A duration of zero seconds shall be accepted providing that the
    transferred data volume is greater than zero.

  2) The same method of truncation/rounding shall be applied to both single

This parameter holds the control plane IP address of the GGSN, PGW or SMF
that handles one or more media component(s) of a IMS session. If GPRS is
used to access the IMS, the GGSN address is used together with the GPRS
charging ID as the access part of the charging correlation vector. The
charging correlation vector is comprised of an access part and an IMS part,
which is the IMS Charging Identifier. For further information regarding the
composition of the charging correlation vector refer to the appropriate
clause in TS 32.240 [1].




5.1.3.1.18  GPRS Charging ID

This parameter holds the charging identifier of GPRS, EPS and 5GS access
network:

  -   GPRS charging ID (GCID) which is generated by the GGSN for a GPRS PDP
    context. There is a 1:1 relationship between the GCID and the PDP
    context. If GPRS is used to access the IMS, the GCID is used together
    with the GGSN address as the access part of the charging correlation
    vector that is comprised of an access part and an IMS part, which is
    the IMS Charging Identifier.

5.1.3.1.18A Void


5.1.3.1.19  IMS Charging Identifier

This parameter holds the IMS charging identifier (ICID) as generated by the
IMS node for the SIP session/transaction. The value of the ICID parameter
is identical with the 'icid-value' parameter defined in TS 24.229 [210].
The 'icid-value' is a mandatory part of the P-Charging-Vector and coded as
a text-based UTF-8 charset (as are all SIP messages). For further
information regarding the composition and usage of the P-Charging-Vector
refer to TS 32.260 [20], TS 24.229 [210] and RFC 7315 [404].

The ICID value is globally unique across all 3GPP IMS networks for a time
period of at least one month, implying that neither the node that generated
this ICID nor any other IMS node reuse this value before the uniqueness
period expires.  The one month minimum uniqueness period counts from the
time of release of the ICID, i.e. the ICID value no longer being used. This
can be achieved by using node specific information, e.g. high-granularity
time information and/or topology/location information.  The exact method
how to achieve the uniqueness requirement is an implementation issue.

At each SIP session unrelated method, both initial and subsequent (e.g.,
REGISTER, NOTIFY, MESSAGE etc.), a new, session unrelated ICID is generated
at the first IMS network element that processes the method. This ICID value
is contained in the SIP request and SIP response of that SIP transaction
and must be valid for the duration of the transaction.

At each SIP session establishment a new, session specific ICID is generated
at the first IMS network element that processes the session-initiating SIP
INVITE message. This ICID is then used in all subsequent SIP messages for
that session (e.g., SIP 200 OK, SIP (RE-)INVITE, SIP BYE etc.) until the
session is terminated.


5.1.3.1.20  IMS Communication Service Identifier

This parameter holds the IMS Communication Service Identifier (ICSI) as

3GPP TS 24.229 [210].

  -  For the roaming architecture for voice over IMS with local breakout,
    the value of IMS visited network identifier is a pre-provisioned string
    that identifies the network of the P-CSCF at the home network.

  -  For the roaming architecture for voice over IMS with home routed
    traffic, IMS visited network identifier is a string that identifies the
    visited network of the UE including an indication that the P-CSCF is
    located in the home network.

only applicable to MM1 CDRs.

The Charged Parties are as follows:

  -  Sender: This indicates the sending party is expected to be charged
    ('normal' charging model);

  -  Recipient: This indicates the receiving party is expected to be
    charged ('reverse' charging model). This model implies there is a
    commercial agreement between the Recipient and the VASP;

         6  CDR encoding rules


6.0  Introduction

TS 32.297 [52] specifies the file based protocol for the "Bx" interface
between the CDR generating node, i.e. the Charging Gateway Functionality,
and the operator's Billing Domain (BD) (refer to TS 32.240 [1] for details
on the charging architecture). The following subclauses define

  - the various CDR encodings that are standardised within 3GPP,

  - a method how to indicate the encoding applied to the CDRs,

  - a version indication of the encoded CDRs.

The latter two items can be used by the system(s) in the BD to easily
detect the encoding version used. See TS 32.297 [52] for a detailed
description on how this information is used on the Bx interface.


6.1  3GPP standardized encodings

The contents of the CDRs sent on the Bx interface are defined by the ASN.1
language clause 5. A number of transfer syntaxes, or encodings, is
specified for use in 3GPP systems as follows. For the CDR transfer via the
Bx interface, as defined in TS 32.297 [52], the Basic Encoding Rules (ITU-T
Recommendation X.690 [301]) encoding must be supported by all 3GPP systems.
Optionally, other additional CDR encodings, i.e. Packed Encoding Rules (ITU-
T Recommendation X.691 [302]) and XML Encoding Rules (ITU-T Recommendation
XER [303]) may also be offered.

The encoding applied to the CDRs is indicated by means of the "Data Record
Format" parameter. The following "Data Record Format" values are used:

  - "1" signifies the use of Basic Encoding Rules (BER);

  - "2" signifies the use of unaligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);

  - "3" signifies the use of aligned basic Packed Encoding Rules (PER);

  - "4" signifies the use of XML Encoding Rules (XER).


6.2  Encoding version indication

An indication of the version of the CDR definition and encoding must be
included in the CDR files transferred via the Bx interface specified in TS
32.297 [52]. This version indication consists of a Release Identifier and a
Version Identifier.

For CDRs specified in references in middle tier Charging TS 32.250 [10] to
TS 32.275 [35], applying the syntax as described in clause 5 of the present
document, the version indicator "6", signifying 3GPP Rel-6, shall be
applied. The Version Identifier shall carry the value of the middle digit
of the version number of the present document, i.e. "0" for the first
version under change control, and values "1" and following for any
subsequent, modified version as appropriate.
